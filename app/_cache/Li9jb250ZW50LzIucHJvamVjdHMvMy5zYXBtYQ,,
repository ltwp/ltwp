                <p>Studio Applied Math is an idea that has been rumbling around my head since the end of high school. I have always loved math (something I credit to an incredible string of great math teachers and professors), but as I progress I have grown tired of the same boring format: lectures with little student involvement, problem sets, and in-class closed-book exams. This can work for basic material, but at the high levels feels ineffective and outdated.</p>

<p>My favorite classes have always been "studios." A studio-style classroom is more student-taught, but professor-guided; it focuses on diverse viewpoints to solve open-ended problems. Students work on long-term projects, instead of week-to-week problem sets.</p>

<p>What happens when we apply this classroom structure to the subject of mathematics? A team of students, led by me, my friend Mara Freilich, and our mentor Bjorn Sandstede, are seeking to find out in a student-designed class in Spring 2015. Keep tuned at <a href="http://studioapma.tumblr.com">Studio APMA</a>.</p>
