## About Me

I'm an applied mathematician with broad interests. I like structures, spaces, dynamics.

View [my writing](http://ltwp.net/projects/writing) and [my workshops](http://ltwp.net/projects/workshops).

I am currently finishing my time as an undergraduate at Brown University. I am a TA in the Division of Applied Mathematics and am the head manager at the [Brown Design Workshop](http://www.brown.edu/research/projects/design-workshop/about-us), where I was a founding member. I give tours at the [RISD Museum](http://risdmuseum.org).

Previously, professionally, I have done fluids research on an NSF grant, technical research on social systems and networks at [Thicket](http://thisisthicket.net), and furniture building with [Boris Bally](http://borisbally.com). I continue to be associated with [Brown STEAM](http://brown.steamwith.us).

Some skills I can offer:

+ Interdisciplinary Research
+ Dynamic and agent-based modeling
+ MATLAB, Mathematica, LaTeX
+ Workshop Planning and Execution
+ Microsoft and Google document suites
+ Wood- and Metal-working
+ Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator
+ Fabric Construction
+ HTML/CSS
+ Javascript, jQuery, various libraries.
+ Arduino & Processing
+ Rhino 3D (currently learning)
+ Python (currently learning)
