# Research

I am a researcher, currently as a PhD student under Mark Stacey in UC Berkeley's <a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/">CEE</a>. I am partially supported via the USGS and have worked with federal scientists out of the Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center.  I enjoy collaborating with people in different places and disciplines. 

At the broadest scale, I am interested in understanding the forces that dictate the shape of our coastal regions. More specifically, research topics include: 
- hydrodynamics and morphologic change in low-energy coastal systems
- sediment transport & connectivity in low-energy coastal systems
- anthropogenic modification to estuarine systems
- management of coastal risk and sediment
- mathematical analysis of estuarine dynamics

I am primarily interested in collecting data in the field using environmental sensors, but connecting these data to larger spatial and temporal timescales using remote sensing is crucial. 

Outside of technical questions, I am energized by material history and historical ecology around related topics, and am keen to celebrate citizen-scale participation in environmental management and action.
