        <p>I grew up the son of a geographer, and as such have an appreciation for maps. However anachronistic you may think, mapping hasn't gone anywhere. Tool suites and services are in full swing from <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">map-making</a> to <a href="http://www.terrapattern.com/">visual geographic searching</a> to <a href="https://www.planet.com/">pioneering satellite imagery</a>. Google even has <a href="https://terrabella.google.com/">its own initiative, Terra Bella</a> after acquiring Skybox Imaging.</p>

<p>Of course, geography isn't cartography. Geography is the study of land and its use—and these services aren't just providing maps—they're making maps easier to make, analyze, quantify, and mobilize. Often for the sake of supply chain management, geopolitical security, and critical cartography.</p>

<p>Since being in LA, land use has been on the brain. Many cities I've visited I can parameterize in terms of other cities—Washington, DC : Baltimore :: Boston : Providence, for instance. Antwerp felt like a tiny instance of an Amsterdam-Paris lovechild. Chicago can be seen as a mishmash of New York and Detroit. But Los Angeles broke my pre-existing set of basis vectors. I have to add some dimension to my classification system to fit Los Angeles in.</p>

<p>LA's urban topology coupled with its fascinating freeway infrastructure and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Valley_Lake">absurd relationship with water</a> bring urban design and landscape planning into full view as I walk, bike, and drive around.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bigmapblog.com/maps/map05/UHYCvctoGOZUeuag.jpg">Here's a huge map of the 1920 Los Angeles Electric Railway system</a>. Anyone who's lived in LA, or, like me, is furiously motoring around to find an apartment to inhabit, will recognize that not all of neighborhood names still apply.</p>

<p>The one that stood out most was that Los Feliz is now definitively south of the LA River—it's between Downtown and Hollywood. How does a neighborhood move?</p>

<p>Well, it's the name that moved. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/great-reads/la-me-los-feliz-20130507-dto-htmlstory.html">Pronunciation too</a>. (Uninformed linguistic speculation: the "so cal" accent is midwest + Spanish mish-mashed?) The <a href="https://www.lfia.org/RegPages/History.shtml">1903 Geological Survey Map here</a> indicates that Los Feliz was indeed West of the LA River. The original deed indicates so as well. As best I can tell, Los Feliz wasn't annexed into the City of Los Angeles proper until 1910—so you'd hope by 1920 the naming would have settled somewhat. Is it a one-off error, or was there some naming switcheroo around 1920 that has since reversed?</p>

<p>That's as far as my hunt will go today. Perhaps I can call someone up tomorrow, or maybe I'll let it sit there. There's too much online; at some point you have too many open tabs going nowhere and need to call it at that.</p>

<p>Figuring out what to prioritize and what to let slide long been difficult for me, and is always in flux. I'm not sure if that's because of who I am, or because of my age, or otherwise. I've recently settled on saying my three chief interests are "education, mathematics, and landscape" in no particular order, and this feels good for now. Something between those three, with a specter behind them of "art." But more on that another day.</p>

<p>For now, I'm trying to prioritize going for more walks and bike rides so as to be in the landscape. And boy, does LA do <a href="http://clui.org/">analysis</a> of <a href="http://laforum.org/">land</a> <a href="http://lmlab.org/about/">use</a>. I also finally got the <a href="http://playhopscotch.net">Hopscotch</a> sewing machine fixed, so I patched up a couple pairs of pants and my messenger bag. Gratifying to spend an afternoon doing physical work.</p>

        <p>I'm going to leave twitter. I have toyed with this idea for years, and vaguely attempted it a few times, but now it's necessary.</p>

<p>It's amazing anyone gets anything done, to me. I want to follow everything, consume everything I see. I can spend all day reading articles and books and watching things people recommend, only to end the day with some thoughts in my head and eyes pained by a long day at a screen.</p>

<p>I know that unless I make something, I don't synthesize. I have to write to understand, and build to see how something works. (For this reason I've started writing a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-nazAYHmrM3OjfxIDBB69S5DphIVbwuuOpT_8-l6Q58/edit#gid=0">short summary of everything I read</a> that takes more than ~15minutes.)</p>

<p>Attempts to keep up with the consumption and interests of my friends is stripping me of time to develop and pursue my own interests. (They obviously aren't mutually exclusive, though!)</p>

<p>I don't even have a very good filter between "what's interesting/relevant" to me and what isn't. And I don't want to change this—I think it helps me <a href="http://ltwp.net/interviews/?/joshua/">celebrate the things at my periphery</a> and keep a broad perspective on my work.</p>

<p>Pulling myself off twitter hurts for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have met tons of amazing people and keep in touch with many through the site.</p></li>
<li><p>Twitter enables dissemination &amp; construction of digital work in an intuitive mode.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But, in response:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I feel secure in my network right now. I feel comfortable, for the first time in 5 years, getting out of a "meeting people" mode.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't want to be involved so much in short-term media content cycles. Time on twitter makes me feel like I can't construct a thought longer than a few tweets. While I know this is by no means unique to me, and that media is both crucial and inescapable, there are many who seem to navigate it in a healthier way.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am part of a digital city and hope to leave the <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/monica_l_smith-infrastructure-as-dialogue">infrastructural engagement</a> of public-construction to other members of the commons. Perhaps people who enjoy it, or get paid for it.</p>

<p>The projects that are most fulfilling to me are long-term finite products. Making my pneumatic bubble, developing the space of the BDW, publishing a research paper. I want to reclaim a longer wavelength in my thinking patterns, something that I feel twitter actively chips away at.</p>

<p>I might still announce some projects on here as they come, but if you want to chat, send me an email! lukaswinklerprins@gmail.com.</p>

        <p>I got back from Joshua Tree earlier today in a bit of a haze. Partly from a fun, loose weekend, but also because of the raw landscape between Joshua Tree and Los Angeles. Joshua Tree itself is surreal—truly geological in (spatial) scale and otherwise a charmingly weird desert outpost.</p>

<p>Some time before coming West I read <a href="http://hauntedmachines.com/HowlingWind.html">this amazing Georgina Voss essay</a>. My interests in land use have been steadily growing, so mixing that with musings on alternative energy and tech mysticism totally got my goat. But I didn't internalize that it was all just East of LA.</p>

<p>Then, on my drive from Tucson to Los Angeles, I drove through the windfarm. It's insane—a true spectacle of infrastructure up against raw landscape. I didn't remember the essay; I was simply awestruck.</p>

<p>Seeing it again reified its intensity. Wind, rock, and water (or lack thereof) are the key tools in geomorphology, and here they all felt present. There's a reason folks came to the <a href="http://landarts.org/">American West to install land art</a>—the property is cheap, the land is easy to work with, and the sky is big. Being a land artist here makes you feel like you can play a hand in the same round as mother nature.</p>

<p>I wonder if there could be more art that engages with wind as an object of interest. Or if I could afford to gain a keener interest in sailing. Wind is so slippery, it evades that inevitable commodification of material art. But land art and conceptual art are linked in that often it is the fact of the posit that stands for the thing more than the realization; most land art will be talked about far more than looked-at. <a href="http://greg.org/archive/2016/09/09/double_double.html">Sturtevant played this game well</a>.</p>

<p>Los Angeles has ignited the urbanist in me. It's a city that forces me to rethink the parameters by which I evaluate a city. I'm excited by the places where wind, rock, and water have rammed into concrete, power lines, human flesh. The LA river has been tamed and feels near-death. The mountains are ever-present but  midcentury bungalows are perched on top.</p>

<p>I'm glad Joshua Tree is a protected national park, but I also think the surrealism would almost be amplified if people were living amongst the rocks, bewildered that infrastructure can carry that far, considering what else might have been done with that scrappy plot of desert dirt.</p>

        <p>I'm a huge proponent of the website ARE.NA. On a few occasions I've had to <a href="https://www.are.na/charles-broskoski/how-do-you-describe-are-na-at-a-party">explain to friends</a> what exactly ARE.NA is.</p>

<p>In 2010 Randall Munroe at XKCD proposed a <a href="https://xkcd.com/802/">map of online communities</a>—an interesting posit of online topography. ARE.NA, to me, then, is a tool for articulating internet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">topology</a>. "Blocks" of digital media are arranged and correlated by a loose community in a non-hierarchical network. XKCD's topography focused on communities and public discourse, thereby spatializing people and discussion. ARE.NA seeks to suss out relationships in the discretized digital landscape—finding interrelated ideas and following rabbit-holes of thoughts. XKCD's map drew lines between language and in-groups; ARE.NA forges connections between online media.</p>

<p>Of course they are inseparable. Language is media. Thanks to reverse-image search and good computer vision, we can move from word-to-image and <a href="http://projectnaptha.com/">image-to-word</a> easier than ever before.</p>

<p>Especially with today's digital climate, it's nearly impossible—or perhaps meaningless—to produce work without, too, talking about it: introducing it to a public. This is something scientists seem often to forget, especially in the esoteric corners of quantitative science, where a paper might have a readership in the single-digits. Is this meaningful work if nobody reads it?</p>

<p>You probably know how to get people to read something you make, but you don't want to employ all the strategies clickbait companies pursue. You think better of your audience. It's tough out there.</p>

<p>The internet is many things. It's a network—eponymously—to be traversed, an ocean to be surfed, and, increasingly, a war  of nations to be politicized. Don't forget to do a little <a href="http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/homesteading-2014/">online homesteading</a>, or, as I like to call it, "tending to [your] digital garden." Support a platform like ARE.NA, or Pinboard, that makes it easy to download everything in the case of the platform's inevitable death.</p>

<p>On the topic of gardens, my friend Édouard and I have been slowly working towards something at learning-gardens.co, and suddenly a few others have joined on. We're interested in supporting and encouraging self-started learning groups. Come chat.</p>

<p>I'm feeling somewhat pulled thin these days. I'm still looking for jobs, looking for apartments, looking for a sense of self in the vast parking lot of Los Angeles. I wish I had better terms with which to describe myself—I'm not a mathematician, I'm not a designer, I'm not a writer—I'm not much except myself. Nor do I want to be any of those things anyway. I guess I just wish I could say I was something. Perhaps an internet topologist.</p>

        <p>I quit tumblr in June and don't miss it.</p>

<p>I've been trying to remove "queues" from my life. In 2015 I deleted some extremely long-standing lists of movies to watch &amp; books to read. Both were hundreds long. It was liberating; they were weighty and I felt guilt whenever I wasn't working through them. Pursuing interests shouldn't feel like a checklist. I quit the tumblr dashboard in 2014—unfollowing everyone, and just manually checking the few tumblrs I care about—and started to enjoy tumblr again. I quit RSS in 2015.</p>

<p>It's tough on a media like twitter, where the streams are more fine-grained and I want to follow many more. Twitter requires a comfort with simply "surfing" the stream—or, as <a href="http://morgane.com/">Morgane</a> would say, "stand-up paddleboarding" the stream. I can't treat the twitter feed as a queue to read through—it's too noisy and disjointed. It makes me worry I have attention issues. I just poke around the top of my algorithmically sorted timeline and hope that was enough.</p>

<p>Just yesterday I quit Instapaper, one of my long-standing favorite web services. I love Instapaper, and might go back to it if I do a lot of text-based research (its full-text search is wonderful!) but for now, it was another long queue of articles I wanted to read "eventually." Eventually meant never.</p>

<p>In this vein of surfing, if I come across something on the web and I want to read it, I either have to read it on the spot, or distinctly schedule time to read it. It's my application of this "Eisenhower Planning Matrix":</p>

<p><img src="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/660895/large_db94888af2365abbe2234d62c339e6f2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Clearly this means first deciding that reading said online thing is "important." Which is a step I need to practice for my general sanity and productivity.</p>

<p>On Friday I went surfing for the second time in my life. What an amazing way to unplug—no phone out in the saltwater!—and slow down, tune into nature. You see a wave and you have to go for it. Delaying too much will mean you have a bum day on the waves.</p>

<p>You go out, celebrate what you get while you're there, and then you go home. No regrets on the waves you aren't catching when you're having a post-surf burrito.</p>

<p>But I think about blogging. I love collecting images and links very much, and blogs like <a href="http://chneukirchen.org/trivium/">Trivium</a> and <a href="http://kottke.org">Kottke</a> have inspired me for years. I wonder if I could curate a readership, or if this is the kind of thing for Tiny Letter. I wonder if I would rather be surfing.</p>
