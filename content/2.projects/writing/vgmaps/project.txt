description:

For my final project in a cartographic history class at RISD, taught by Dr Christina Connett, I wrote an essay about spatial representation in video games and its ramifications in allowing for player in-game identity creation. I consider it one of my better research papers in college and opened my eyes to further rabbit holes of critical theory.
