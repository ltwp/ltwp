words1:

Freshman year I was a freshman in [Northwestern's McCormick](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/), and the  sequence included two design/build projects for local clients. The second prompt, for my group of 4, was to help the music department launch a clarinet as the opening sequence for a documentary.
