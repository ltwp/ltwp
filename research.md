# Research

I am a researcher, currently as a PhD student under Mark Stacey in UC Berkeley's <a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/">CEE</a>. I am partially supported via the USGS and have worked with federal scientists out of the Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center.  I enjoy collaborating with people in different places and disciplines. 

My interests, at the broadest scale, are in the forces that shape our coastal areas. I am interested in this out of a desire to do basic science that can inform how to mitigate coastal erosion and flooding hazards, and to support healthy ecosystems that depend on particular coastal landforms. To this end, I am particularly curious how the ways in which humans modify the landscape ultimately affect the shape of the coast. 

To pursue these interests, I analyze the hydrodynamics, sediment budgets, and morphologic change along coastlines. I am primarily interested in field techniques, but also see value in remote sensing techniques to reach larger spatial and temporal scales. I have a background in applied mathematics, so I especially enjoy marrying field observations with analytical models, allowing me to take a "dynamic systems"-flavored approach. 

I have a variety of technical skills: comfort with a variety of mathematical and statistical techniques; familiarity with many oceanographic sensors (Ruskin, Nortek, Sequoia) as well as more general environmental sensing experience; practice with field work by foot and by boat on teams both large and small; ability to script in MATLAB (expert), python (intermediate), and javascript (beginner); comfort in Google Earth Engine, QGIS, and Adobe Creative Cloud products.
