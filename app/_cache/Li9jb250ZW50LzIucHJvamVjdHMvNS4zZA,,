            <div id="description">
                <p>Senior year of high school I made an oak and steel coffee table.</p>

<p>Freshman year of college, at Northwestern University, I was involved in two design projects through the School of Engineering. The first was prototyping a <a href="./etc/carboncurve.pdf">carbon-fiber rollator</a>, and the second was working to <a href="./etc/rockinet.pdf">launch a clarinet</a> like a rocket as a promotional event for the School of Music.</p>

<p>Since then, I have mostly done projects for play. I am familiar with most standard-fare workshop machines and hand tools, in addition to Arduino programming, carbon-fiber layups, laser cutting, and 3D printing.</p>

<p>Right now I am interested in making musical instruments, and am an apprentice with a local sculptor and furniture maker <a href="http://borisbally.com">Boris Bally</a>. I work as a shop monitor in the <a href="http://brown.edu/research/projects/design-workshop/about-us">Brown Design Workshop</a> where I teach metals and laser cutting.</p>
