description:

I went to high school at [Cranbrook Kingswood](http://cranbrook.edu), an amazing place that gave me enormous appreciation for the arts. I was lucky enough to have a world-class art museum literally in my backyard, and in my final years of high school I became a docent there.

And so, too, in my last two years of college. The [RISD Museum](http://risdmuseum.org) is an amazing institution with an enormous collection to boot. I see docenting as a way for me to engage with art history and practice my public speaking, in addition to teaching people how awesome art museums are.

I have designed two tours, using objects from the permanent collection:

* _The Touch of the Artist_, focusing on remnants of artists' gestures in their work and what it means.
* _The Mathematician's Museum_, an examination of similarities in the investigations of artists and mathematicians.

I have delivered each of these tours upwards of five times to groups of various size, age range, background, and interest.

My third tour is in-progress.
