# Research

I am a researcher, currently as a PhD candidate working with Mark Stacey out of University of California Berkeley's <a href="http://efmh.berkeley.edu/efmhgroup/about.html">EFMH Group</a> and with Jessie Lacy out of the US Geological Survey's <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc">Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center</a>. I enjoy collaborating with many people and during graduate school I have also been a part of <a href="https://largier.sf.ucdavis.edu">Coastal Oceanography Group</a> at UCD in Davis, California, and the <a href="http://obrasciviles.usm.cl/investigacion/lineas-de-investigacion/estudios-de-procesos-e-ingenieria-costera/">Grupo de Procesos e Ingeniería Costera</a> at USM in Valparaíso, Chile.

At the broadest scale, I am interested in the myriad forces that affect how coastal regions (especially marshes & mangroves) "work". I seek to study:

- coastal hydrodynamics and sediment transport
- geomorphology and landscape change around estuaries
- restoration engineering and blue carbon assessment
- mathematical analysis of coastal physics and hazards
- effective use of in-situ sensors 

I work primarily as a field scientist, but I understand that connecting field data to larger spatiotemporal scales using remote sensing and modeling applications is crucial. 

Outside of technical questions, I am energized by cultural theory and historical ecology of water and infrastructure. I want to support degrowth-oriented and citizen-centered environmental science, management, and activism. This includes good education, low-impact methods, small-group organizing, and independent institutions.
