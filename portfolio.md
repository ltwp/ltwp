# Portfolio

Here are some of my public-facing written pieces: 

- 2016: _[Math and Mysticism](https://avant.org/project/math-and-mysticism/)_ (AVANT), a piecewise essay on the intertwined histories of mathematics and numerology (note, this site is not online at this moment, but this piece is also old...). 
- 2020: Narrative of sediment research in San Francisco Bay as a piece for "[From the Field](https://berkeleysciencereview.com/article/2020/05/10/from-the-field)" (Berkeley Science Review). 
- 2021: _[Where The Sea Flows Uphill](https://climatefiction.site/blog/flows-uphill)_ (Civilian Climate Futures Project), a short story on speculative futures of restoring the Tijuana Estuary. The CCFP project as a whole was also co-created by me, with Bryan Lehrer. 
- 2022: _[Portals to Elsewhere](https://www.are.na/editorial/portals-to-elsewhere)_ (Are.na Blog), reflection on surf cameras and surf culture. 
- 2023: Deck of cards to practice [Acts of Environmental Intimacy](https://discjournal.net/) (DISC Journal vol. 2), in collaboration with Austin Wade Smith. 

I also gave a "lecture" in 2021 to [TRUST](http://trust.support) titled GREEN SPACE AS INFRASTRUCTURE SPACE, which you can see [here](https://vimeo.com/933087635) (pw is protocols). 

Less relevant, but I am also currently in academia. My scholarly articles and data publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1xjkTv0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)!
