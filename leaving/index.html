  <em>DEAR FRIENDS . . .</em><br /><br />
  <p>
      I am leaving Los Angeles. I don't know if it is forever or not. This makes me really sad.
  </p>
  <p>
      LA beat me up then gave me a hugâ€”over the duration of the past two years.
  </p>
  <p>
      As with any place, one's memories of space are intertwined with thoughts and conversations and friends.
  </p>
  <p>
      Before I move out, I'd like to try to get together and... hang out. At a park. Bring a book or beer or a camera or just some things you want to talk about.
  </p>
  <p>
      Maybe we can go out for a drink afterwards.
  </p>
  <p>
      Anyhoo, join me at the trees near the bleachers at Rio De Los Angeles State Park on Saturday, June 23rd at 5:30pm(ish). It's in Glassell Park and there's lots of parking.
