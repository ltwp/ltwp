I have wide interests and can generally find anything interesting. 
That said, there are some recurring topics. These include, in no order:

- fluid mechanics, especially environmental hydrodynamics
- resilience of infrastructure and organizations
- effective and well-designed metrics, especially in with extreme value scenarios
- geomorphology, especially regarding sediment lifecycles
- effective pedagogy, in and beyond institutions
- conceptual and performance art, especially at the edge of sculpture
- surfing and the mythology of the surfer
- interior architecture and furniture
- poetry, especially short/minimal poems
