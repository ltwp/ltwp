We launched the [Learning Gardens Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/learningardens/learning-gardens-reader-launch) a week and a half ago and immediately blew through our goal. Floored to be a part of such an exciting project. Read some [campaign updates](http://learning-gardens.co/2017/02/06/kickstarter.html) on our little blog. 

The Kickstarter money is building towards Learning Gardens microgrants—monetary support for groups and self-initiated non-institutional education experiments. Basically, the grants I wish I could apply for. 

I'll be seeking ways to give more time to Learning Gardens in the future. There is so much research we could do—into effective group organization, online community management, pedagogy in the age of the web—and so little time I can give when I'm only scraping by as-is. Perhaps we can find a supportive residency or such.
