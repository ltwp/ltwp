I had the pleasure of taking [HTML Output](http://htmloutput.risd.gd/) in RISD's Graphic Design department under John Caserta. We spent the semester investigating the messy corners and crazy possibilities of the web browser.

My experiments focused on scrolling as a gesture of interaction and defaults built into standard web formats. My knowledge of javascript put me near the front of the ship when making a tool to turn the website into a printable book at the push of a button, too, but this effort was largely driven by the amazing Evan Brooks. I also got to interview a designer I admire, [Ben Pieratt](http://pieratt.com).
