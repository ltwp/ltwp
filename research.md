# Research

I am a researcher and educator, with a Ph.D from the University of California. There, I worked closely with Dr Mark Stacey (UC Berkeley) and Dr Jessie Lacy (USGS) on hydrodynamics and sediment transport in shallow bays and marshlands. Now, I am a postdoctoral scholar at the California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo, assessing coastal hazards along California's Central Coast.

My interests are on how waters in coastal, bay, and estuary regions move stuff around (especially sediment). Thus, I study: 

- estuarine hydrodynamics and coastal physical oceanography
- how hydrodynamics drive sedimentation patterns and geomorphology in coastal regions 
- transport and fate of carbon (or other stuff attached to sediment) 

These interests mean I am effectively a coastal engineer (no P.E. yet, though). I am always thinking about how the fluids-sediment mechanisms are intertwined with infrastructural and ecological function, so I also think about community risks and habitat restoration work. 

I work primarily as a field scientist, trying to make effective use of environmental sensors and observations. But I also believe there is value in connecting in-situ observations to larger spatiotemporal scales using remote sensing techniques and numerical models.

Outside of technical questions, I am energized by cultural theory and historical ecology around bodies of water and infrastructure. I support degrowth-oriented and citizen-centered environmental science, management, and activism. This requires good pedagogy, low-impact/cost methods, small-group organizing, long-term monitoring, and capable institutions. I love doing outreach to younger folks and channel my energy mostly through <a href="https://www.citysurfproject.com/">City Surf Project</a> in San Francisco.
