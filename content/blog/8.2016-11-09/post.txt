It's a dark time to be an American. As much as it was foreseeable, I really didn't want to believe Trump would win. 

My biggest concern, now, is the environment. [Quartz Summarizes the issue well](http://qz.com/833859/with-trump-as-president-china-will-be-the-worlds-biggest-champion-of-fighting-climate-change/), noting that with Trump as the figurehead, America has lost its energy leadership position internationally, and has become addled domestically. It wasn't looking bright anyway, and now it's downright apocalyptic. [Trump's Energy Policy](https://www.greatagain.gov/policy/energy-independence.html) reads like an 8th-grade short-response essay, and not even a good one at that. 

This is, of course, a long-term, at-a-distance impact. Something I can consider as a straight white atheistic man with an American passport. For many Americans, his presidency entails an immediate new terrifying reality of validated hatred and oppression. Even if zero of Trump's policies go into play, we have a vessel for hatred as the figurehead of the United States. His picture in elementary school classrooms. 

What to do? I want to get out of the way. Yet here I type, filling up space. If you're like me, the first reaction is deep sadness and death. I probably can't do much with my life, and while I'm alive, I'm white weight holding back a country that's too good for white people. 

But you can still help while not getting too much in the way. I'll make the leap and say that I don't need to die. On top of that assumption, though, there aren't really any excuses. Is my life and work oriented towards civic benefit? Am I critical not only of myself, but also at least a few layers of abstraction above and below me? Am I amplifying voices who need it, rather than my own? Don't forget, too, that [ANY SURPLUS IS IMMORAL (thanks, Jenny)](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~field/holzer/truisms.txt). And, in one of the most striking reads of recent history, there's only so much [self-care you can justify](http://thebaffler.com/blog/laurie-penny-self-care), too. 

"Youth is wasted on the young," they say, and I've been trying to make that not true for myself. Youth, though, does bring a weight—our interests and habits at a young age reverberate long through life. As someone without burning desires, I've struggled to commit myself to things out of fear that I'll trap myself for too long. I've been pretty paralyzed for years. 

Trump's election is a kick in the butt. (Alongside the move to LA and, you know, becoming an adult in general.) There isn't time to wait to mobilize, personally or communally. The time is now! We have to enact our morals in a public space. I want to get out of the design world—not something I feel like I can't do at civic scales—and move into land use, geography, and energy. I've been flirting with this, but now it's time to commit.

If you want a playlist for diving into what I'll call a "heavy headspace" (deep ambient?), I recommend: [Selfless State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59BIX16RSkU), [Broken by Roberto Rodriguez](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqmA5GDBdWM), [LOVE by James Booth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1V5AyscLAI), and then [Nuit Sonores by Floating Points]([Nuit Sonores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LtsjqgF6fw)).
