# Research

I am a researcher, currently as a PhD student under Mark Stacey in UC Berkeley's <a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/">CEE</a>. I am part of <a href="http://efmh.berkeley.edu/efmhgroup/about.html">EFMH</a> at Berkeley and a contributor to <a href="https://largier.sf.ucdavis.edu">COG</a> at UC Davis. I am partially supported by the US Geological Survey, working with Jessie Lacy and other federal scientists out of the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc">Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center</a>. I enjoy collaborating with people in different places and disciplines. 

At the broadest scale, I am interested in the myriad forces that affect how coastal regions (especially marshes & mangroves) "work". I am interested in:

- hydrodynamics and sediment transport in estuaries
- coastal geomorphology and landscape change
- restoration engineering and blue carbon assessment
- mathematical analysis of coastal physics and hazards
- effective use of in-situ sensors 

I work primarily as a field scientist, but I understand that connecting field data to larger spatial and temporal timescales using remote sensing and modeling applications is crucial. 

Outside of technical questions, I am energized by cultural study and historical ecology as applied to water and infrastructure. I am keen on sovereignty through citizen-centered environmental management, science, and activism. I channel some of these interests through membership at <a href="https://trust.support/">TRUST</a>.
