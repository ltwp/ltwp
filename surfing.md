# Surf Lessons

I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar in wetland dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley. To supplement my income, I'm doing some surf coaching!

I first learned to surf in 2016, so I know what it is like to be an adult learner. Since then, I have surfed in many places and challenging waves across the world and mostly in our backyard breaks in the Bay Area. In early 2024, I did a week-long surfing intensive in Mexico to bolster my skills and learn more about the surf coaching industry. At home, I've been involved in many surfing-oriented events and organizations (like Surfrider). This is all to say: I love surfing and I love bringing more people into the most magical activity I know. 

I have a very flexible schedule and know the breaks across the Bay Area well. **My goal is to provide 1-on-1 facilitation and lessons for beginners with serious intent.** Best is for people between the stages of "never surfed before" (but hopefully have some swimming ability) to "figuring out how to nail a bottom turn." If you want a lesson with more than one person, let's discuss your goals first. 

If you have your own equipment, great. If not, I can provide it or find us what you need. I can pick you up from your home, or we can meet at a designated break in advance. 

I will provide: 

- Choice of location to optimize your experience based on an agreed-upon time. 
- On-land lessons, gear, and support (including snacks!) 
- In-water guidance, including pushing you into waves as-needed. 
- In-water photos, to document your journey! (I shoot on film, so it will take some time after a session to get your pics.)
- For more advanced learners, I can provide feedback or footage from the beach. 
- Follow-up on your progress and sharing resources for how to learn more. 

We will surf wherever in San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo County, or Santa Cruz works for your schedule and skill level! I live in Oakland, so it is relatively easy for me to coordinate across the entire Bay Area. 

My rates start at $80/hour for our time together, with extra fees if drive times are over 1 hour or for rental equipment. I'm figuring this out as I go, so let's talk about it! 

If you are interested, please email me LUKAS AT LTWP DOT NET with your phone number, and I'll give you a call back ASAP!
