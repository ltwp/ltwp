name: I Love My Scanner

words1:

In 2008, I moved away from home into a tiny room and quickly realized I was quite a packrat. In attempt to keep this at bay, I started scanning things as a way to remember them and let myself throw them out. I created a tumblr, “I Love My Scanner,” to document all of my scans, as a cathartic act.

It was featured in a [Tumblr Tuesday](http://staff.tumblr.com/post/171361070/tumblr-tuesday) post early on and gained some attention.

The blog is now-deleted, in another act of trying to get rid of excess in my life. But I still scan.
