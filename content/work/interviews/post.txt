# [Reflecting Forward: An Interview Project &rarr;](http://ltwp.net/interviews/)

This is a project by Lukas alone. As I graduated from college, my friends—mostly aspiring artists and designers—went through the stresses of closing their degrees and launching personal practices. 

Interviewing them on their projects and thoughts for the future helped me navigate this transition, too, while giving them the space to reflect. By sharing, I hoped to make clear the ambiguity of direction yet ambitious attitude in these early-state creators.
