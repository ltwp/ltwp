# Research

I am a researcher, currently as a PhD student under Mark Stacey in UC Berkeley's <a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/">CEE</a>. I am partially supported via the US Geological Survey, working with federal scientists out of the Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center.  I enjoy collaborating with people in different places and disciplines. 

At the broadest scale, I am interested in understanding the forces that dictate the shape of our coastal regions. More specifically, I am interested in sediment dynamics in estuaries/bays, how tides and waves move material around coastal regions, and the engineered management of these processes. 
- hydrodynamics and morphologic change in low-energy coastal systems
- sediment budgets, transport, & connectivity in coastal systems
- anthropogenic modification, restoration, and management of coastal systems
- mathematical analysis of estuarine dynamics and coastal risk

I work primarily as a field scientist, but connecting field data to larger spatial and temporal timescales using remote sensing and modeling applications is crucial. 

Outside of technical questions, I am energized by the characteristics of human-nature relations and material history or historical ecology around estuaries and bays. I am keen to celebrate citizen-scale participation in environmental management and action. And I love to teach.
