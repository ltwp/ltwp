name: Polynomial Graphs on Finite Fields

words1:

In the second half of Studio Applied Math, I teamed up with Daniel Keliher (Brown '17) to investigate the structures of graphs made by polynomial dynamics on finite fields. That is, we are curious what shapes of graphs emerge by choosing polynomials and watching where elements of cyclic sets jump around.

Our investigation began with a literature review, took us into deep computationally difficult territory in finding directed graph isomorphisms, and then into truly striking patterns of polynomial isometry.
