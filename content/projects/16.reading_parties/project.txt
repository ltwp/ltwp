name: Reading Parties
-
words1:

In Fall of 2014, my friend [Nathan Zack](http://nathanzack.net) and I were seniors and tired of drinking beer in sweaty basements to meet people. We were actually just tired of always talking with people, when we felt that physical presence was the hallmark of connection with people in college. 

This in mind, we hosted a string of reading parties, where, with conversation discouraged, we would invite people to a “party” in a cozy room, with a warm beverage, and good reading material. With a mixture of friends and strangers, it brought people together in unexpected, non-verbal ways.
