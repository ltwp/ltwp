0. **Your values are implemented in action.** Act towards the things you value—generosity, empathy, kindness, energy, efficacy, avoiding excess, acceptance, sustainability, interestingness, etc. 

1. **Do what you say you will**. The best way to start working in this direction is being very, very careful about what you say “yes” to. Be liberal and gentle with saying “no”.

2. **Seek out primary sources**, and be wary of secondary sources (even newspapers). Don’t read the science digest, read the science. If you can’t understand a primary source, this is a great learning opportunity. Study what you need to understand. 
    
3. **Aim for a balanced life**. Don’t find balance by standing in the middle of everything—instead, hit the extremes and let them stabilize each other. (Some exceptions apply.) Balance is active, not a static state. 

4. **Always be sowing seeds**. Start projects and conversations. Ask yourself leading questions and learn new things relentlessly.

5. **Have a borrowing mindset**. Treat things and people with kindness and agility. Stay liquid and don’t buy until you’ve tried. Don’t get something until you’ll need it, and celebrate what you have. 

6. **Take good care of your body and mind**, they need to last your entire life. This means both working them hard and allowing them to relax. 
	6a. Don’t overeat. Eat good food. Sleep enough. Stretch. This is not a place for extremes, contrary to item number 3. 
	6b. This also includes a judicious media diet. Don’t read it unless you think it will be good or important. 

7. **Keep a beginner’s spirit** but don’t be afraid to fold inwards when necessary. 

8. **Make it easy to make good actions**, and do not dwell in previous ones; just apply learned lessons to those ahead. Think slowly and act quickly. 

9. **Work towards an experimental reality**. Push edges of what you think about and how you think about it. Break rules when necessary. Use your life as n=1. 

10. The thoughts you have, actions you take, people you talk to, and culture you immerse yourself in make permanent marks on you and your identities. **Your experiences and thoughts are objects of their own right, and deserve attention**. 
	10a. “Everything you can imagine is real.” - Picasso

11. **Invest in entropy**. Work towards antifragility. A fairly minimal lifestyle assists in this. 

12. You are a product of immeasurable privilege. **Use your time, energy, and money to learn, educate, and act to the benefit of those without excess**. 

13. **Regularly reflect and reflect-in-action**. You know about many healthy patterns and need to self-check yourself into enacting them, in real time. 

14. **”Solving for” beats “Planning for”**—as in, planning is frequently a way to delay action. Start immediately and consider it part of the process. 

15. **Recognize the value in habits**. Build habits that work with your strengths and weaknesses and construct reflection time. Doing big things requires a lot of time—best achievable through regular scheduling.   
	15a. Note the cost of context-switching! Block your time. 
	
16. You shouldn’t read without writing, nor observe without note-taking. **Synthesis comes through making.**

17. **Do stuff with your friends.** That's what you have them for. Talk and start projects;  generate energy between yourselves. Go to events. Entertain questions.
