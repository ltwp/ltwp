        <p>I grew up the son of a geographer, who regularly pointed my eyes towards map and the landscape around me. However anachronistic you may think, mapping hasn't gone anywhere. Tool suites and services are in full swing from <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">map-making</a> to <a href="http://www.terrapattern.com/">visual geographic searching</a> to <a href="https://www.planet.com/">pioneering satellite imagery</a>. Google even has <a href="https://terrabella.google.com/">its own initiative</a> after acquiring Skybox Imaging.</p>

<p>Of course, geography isn't cartography. Geography is the study of land and its use, not just representations of it. These services aren't just providing maps either—they're making maps easier to make, analyze, quantify, and mobilize for geographic ends; often towards supply chain management, geopolitical security, and critical cartography.</p>

<p>Since being in LA, land use has been on the brain. Many cities can be parameterized in terms of other cities—Washington, DC : Baltimore :: Boston : Providence, for instance. Antwerp felt like a tiny instance of an Amsterdam-Paris lovechild. Chicago can be seen as a mishmash of New York and Detroit. But Los Angeles broke my pre-existing set of basis vectors. I have to add some dimension to my classification system to fit Los Angeles into my framework.</p>

<p>LA's urban topology coupled with its fascinating freeway infrastructure and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Valley_Lake">absurd relationship with water</a> bring urban design and landscape planning into full view as I walk, bike, and drive around.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bigmapblog.com/maps/map05/UHYCvctoGOZUeuag.jpg">Here's a huge map of the 1920 Los Angeles Electric Railway system</a>. Anyone who's lived in LA, or, like me, is furiously motoring around to find an apartment to inhabit, will recognize that not all of neighborhood names still apply.</p>

<p>The one that stood out most was that Los Feliz is now definitively south of the LA River—it's between Downtown and Hollywood. How does a neighborhood move?</p>

<p>Well, it's the name that moved. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/great-reads/la-me-los-feliz-20130507-dto-htmlstory.html">Pronunciation of 'Los Feliz'</a> along with it. (Uninformed linguistic speculation: the "so cal" accent is midwest + Spanish mish-mashed?)</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.lfia.org/RegPages/History.shtml">1903 Geological Survey Map here</a> indicates that Los Feliz was indeed West of the LA River. The original deed indicates so as well. As best I can tell, Los Feliz wasn't annexed into the City of Los Angeles proper until 1910—so you'd hope by 1920 the naming would have settled somewhat. Is it a one-off error, or was there some naming switcheroo around 1920 that has since reversed?</p>

<p>That's as far as my hunt will go today. Perhaps I can call someone up tomorrow, or maybe I'll let it sit there. There's too much online; at some point you have too many open tabs going nowhere and need to call it at that.</p>

<p>Figuring out what to prioritize and what to let slide long been difficult for me, and is always in flux. I'm not sure if that's because of who I am, or because of my age, or otherwise. I've recently settled on saying my three chief interests are "education, mathematics, and landscape" in no particular order, and this feels good for now. The specter behind all three is "art," but more on that another day.</p>

<p>For now, I'm trying to prioritize going for more walks and bike rides so as to be in the landscape. And boy, does LA do <a href="http://clui.org/">analysis</a> of <a href="http://laforum.org/">land</a> <a href="http://lmlab.org/about/">use</a>. I also finally got the <a href="http://playhopscotch.net">Hopscotch</a> sewing machine fixed, so I patched up a couple pairs of pants and my messenger bag. Gratifying to spend an afternoon doing physical work.</p>

        <p>I'm going to leave twitter. I have toyed with this idea for years, and vaguely attempted it a few times, but now it's necessary.</p>

<p>It's amazing anyone gets anything done, to me. I just want to follow everything and consume everything I see. I can spend all day reading articles and books and watching things people recommend, only to end the day with some thoughts in my head and eyes pained by a long day at a screen.</p>

<p>I know that unless I make something, I don't synthesize. I have to write to understand, and build to see how something works. (For this reason I've started writing a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-nazAYHmrM3OjfxIDBB69S5DphIVbwuuOpT_8-l6Q58/edit#gid=0">short summary of everything I read</a> that takes more than ~15minutes.)</p>

<p>Attempts to keep up with the consumption and interests of my friends is stripping me of time to develop and pursue my own interests. (They obviously aren't mutually exclusive, though!)</p>

<p>I don't even have a very good filter between "what's interesting/relevant" to me and what isn't. And I don't want to change this—I think it helps me <a href="http://ltwp.net/interviews/?/joshua/">celebrate the things at my periphery</a> and keep a broad perspective on my work.</p>

<p>Pulling myself off twitter hurts for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have met tons of amazing people and keep in touch with many through the site.</li>
<li>Twitter enables dissemination &amp; construction of digital work in an intuitive mode.</li>
</ol>

<p>But, in response:</p>

<ol>
<li>I feel secure in my network right now. I feel comfortable, for the first time in 5 years, getting out of a "meeting people" mode. </li>
<li>I don't want to be involved so much in short-term media content cycles. Time on twitter makes me feel like I can't construct a thought longer than a few tweets. I think I can find other ways to disseminate &amp; discuss. </li>
</ol>

<p>I am part of a digital city and hope to leave the <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/monica_l_smith-infrastructure-as-dialogue">infrastructural engagement</a> of public-construction to other members of the commons. Perhaps people who enjoy it, or get paid for it.</p>

<p>The projects that are most fulfilling to me are long-term physical realities. Making my pneumatic bubble, developing the space of the BDW, publishing a research paper. I want to reclaim a longer wavelength in my thinking patterns, something that I feel twitter actively chips away at.</p>

<p>I might still announce some projects on twitter as they come, but if you want to chat, send me an email!</p>

<p><em>update 15 October: I've been off twitter for a week! and am starting a little blog instead.</em></p>

        <p>I got back from Joshua Tree earlier today in a bit of a haze. Partly from a fun, loose weekend, but also because of the raw landscape between Joshua Tree and Los Angeles. Joshua Tree itself is surreal—truly geological in (spatial) scale and otherwise a charmingly weird desert outpost.</p>

<p>Some time before coming West I read <a href="http://hauntedmachines.com/HowlingWind.html">this amazing Georgina Voss essay</a>. My interests in land use have been steadily growing, so mixing that with musings on alternative energy and tech mysticism totally got my goat. But I didn't internalize that it was all just East of LA.</p>

<p>Then, on my drive from Tucson to Los Angeles, I drove through the windfarm. It's insane—a true spectacle of infrastructure up against raw landscape. I didn't remember the essay; I was simply awestruck.</p>

<p>Seeing it again reified its intensity. Wind, rock, and water (or lack thereof) are the key tools in geomorphology, and here they all felt present. There's a reason folks came to the <a href="http://landarts.org/">American West to install land art</a>—the property is cheap, the land is easy to work with, and the sky is big. Being a land artist here makes you feel like you can play a hand in the same round as mother nature.</p>

<p>I wonder if there could be more art that engages with wind as an object of interest. Or if I could afford to gain a keener interest in sailing. Wind is so slippery, it evades that inevitable commodification of material art. But land art and conceptual art are linked in that often it is the fact of the posit that stands for the thing more than the realization; most land art will be talked about far more than looked-at. <a href="http://greg.org/archive/2016/09/09/double_double.html">Sturtevant played this game well</a>.</p>

<p>Los Angeles has ignited the urbanist in me. I'm excited by the places where wind, rock, and water have rammed into concrete, power lines, human flesh. The LA river has been tamed and feels near-death. The mountains are ever-present but  midcentury bungalows are perched on top.</p>

<p>I'm glad Joshua Tree is a protected national park, but I also think the surrealism would almost be amplified if people were living amongst the rocks, bewildered that infrastructure can carry that far, considering what else might have been done with that scrappy plot of desert dirt.</p>

        <p>I'm a huge proponent of the website ARE.NA. On a few occasions I've had to <a href="https://www.are.na/charles-broskoski/how-do-you-describe-are-na-at-a-party">explain to friends</a> what exactly ARE.NA is.</p>

<p>In 2010 Randall Munroe at XKCD proposed a <a href="https://xkcd.com/802/">map of online communities</a>—an interesting posit of online topography. ARE.NA, to me, then, is a tool for articulating internet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology">topology</a>. "Blocks" of digital media are arranged and correlated by a loose community in a non-hierarchical network. XKCD's topography focused on communities and public discourse, thereby spatializing people and discussion. ARE.NA seeks to suss out relationships in the discretized digital landscape—finding interrelated ideas and following rabbit-holes of thoughts. XKCD's map drew lines between language and in-groups; ARE.NA forges connections between online media.</p>

<p>Of course they are inseparable. Language is media. Thanks to reverse-image search and good computer vision, we can move from word-to-image and <a href="http://projectnaptha.com/">image-to-word</a> easier than ever before.</p>

<p>Especially with today's digital climate, it's nearly impossible—or perhaps meaningless—to produce work without, too, talking about it: introducing it to a public. This is something scientists seem often to forget, especially in the esoteric corners of quantitative science, where a paper might have a readership in the single-digits. Is this meaningful work if nobody reads it?</p>

<p>You probably know how to get people to read something you make, but you don't want to employ all the strategies clickbait companies pursue. You think better of your audience. It's tough out there.</p>

<p>The internet is many things. It's a network—eponymously—to be traversed, an ocean to be surfed, and, increasingly, a war  of nations to be politicized. Don't forget to do a little <a href="http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/homesteading-2014/">online homesteading</a>, or, as I like to call it, "tending to [your] digital garden." Support a platform like ARE.NA, or Pinboard, that makes it easy to download everything in the case of the platform's inevitable death.</p>

<p>On the topic of gardens, my friend Édouard and I have been slowly working towards something at learning-gardens.co, and suddenly a few others have joined on. We're interested in supporting and encouraging self-started learning groups. Come chat.</p>

<p>I'm feeling somewhat pulled thin these days. I'm still looking for jobs, looking for apartments, looking for a sense of self in <a href="http://bldgblog.com/2007/10/greater-los-angeles/">the vast parking lot of Los Angeles</a>. I wish I had better terms with which to describe myself—I'm not a mathematician, I'm not a designer, I'm not a writer—I'm not much except myself. Nor do I want to be any of those things anyway. I guess I just wish I could say I was something. Perhaps an internet topologist.</p>

        <h1>Arrangement Collage</h1>

<p><code>note: this was an essay I worked on, sporadically, over Summer 2016. It's settled but never quite congealed to a finished form. Posted here for posterity.</code></p>

<p>In 2015, Frank Chimero <a href="http://frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain/">wrote on the “Grain” of the Web</a>, focusing on a web-native media that doesn’t try to fight the inherently rectangle-based HTML Document Object Model (DOM)—also shared with XML and XHTML. This remains true: any site that does not look rectilinear is usually just fooling you; strip the CSS and it’s just a pile of blocks. Perhaps tilted and stretched, or with the corners shaved off, but just a pile of blocks.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/JKDOM.SVG/2000px-JKDOM.SVG.png" alt="Wikimedia-sourced HTML DOM - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model#/media/File:JKDOM.SVG"></p>

<p>As McLuhan would have anticipated, this blocky model has substantial effects toward what web-native media looks like. Chimero documents this well. I’d like to add a psychological component, though, in that as an online culture, we’ve grown accustomed to block-based interfaces. We joke at Web 2.0’s desire to round over corners and balk at clunky Flash plugins; nonlinear, non-blocky interfaces are either salient or sore thumbs.</p>

<p>Native internet users consume media through HTML interfaces at an astounding pace; simple rectangles frame a continuous deluge of multimedia updates. In an age of both physical and digital abundance in the Western world, creation of new media from scratch requires ample justification. Acts of synthesis, archiving, compression, and remix are valuable tools for leveraging information otherwise lost to the unsorted heap. These verbs are ways to construct something new from pre-existing media objects, or at least finding some narrative or meaning within them.</p>

<p>For the internet audience, self-selected content is a necessary tactic for navigating the volume of information available on many web platforms. An explosion of digital “curation” caters to the desire, whether by user directly, tuned algorithms, or third-party human. This manifests when you select topics of interest on Quora and construct a twitter feed of only exactly the people you want. Going to a curated museum is now a relinquishing of control compared to typical digital art consumption, which comes mashed-up through various media platforms.</p>

<p>Even with stream moderation, the modern media viewer is accustomed to lack of coherence between adjacent content blocks. In your tumblr dashboard, a peer-reviewed journal article can sit immediately above an anonymously submitted shitpost. We don’t blink. In an arrangement of DOM blocks, each bit of media similarly carries its own context, history, and qualia. I posit we can effectively navigate our feeds not because we can rapidly jump between the context captured by each DOM block, but rather because we interpolate narrative and construct cohesion. Adjacency implies connection and synthesis, or, in the words of John Berger:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[An image reproduction] becomes itself the reference point for other images. The meaning of an image is changed according to what one sees immediately beside it or what comes immediately after it. (<em>Ways Of Seeing</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marius Watz, in a response on the New Aesthetic, writes on tumblr image culture: “Its art is juxtaposition: If we put this next to that and this other thing, surely a new understanding will emerge.” To be fair, there are uncountably many combinations that may be devoid of meaning—all I mean to point out is that a diptych is a third object, beyond the original two, with the possibility of value. Some find artistic practice in the form of a relentless <a href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/athletic-aesthetics/">stream of rectangles</a>. People go nuts over releases of image dumps from <a href="http://moodmail.org/">Moodmail</a> and <a href="http://www.jjjjound.com/">JJJJound</a>, and the <a href="http://lostimagedesk.com/">Lost Image Desk</a> is making professional practice of it.</p>

<p><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/2a1492983de94afca4090e0620340fe9/tumblr_nzdedbPv1p1v1c8sjo1_1280.jpg" alt="Bono iPod by Zachary Korol-Gold and Andrew Alexander, 2014"></p>

<p>(A scan of contemporary sculpture demonstrates that selection and arrangement of objects—often found or folk objects—is an ongoing trend. The viewer is trusted with finding meaning in the arrangement, selection, formal qualities, cultural context, and more in a relational tradition.)</p>

<p>HTML is perfectly built for image adjacency—a blank and infinite canvas, empowered by right-click “Copy Image Address.” Our expansive tumblrs and pinterest boards act as collected and performed narratives, collages of found digital media.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Traditional] collages, […] were probably laid out carefully, aided by facsimiles, white-out, and tape, existed alongside the book, rather than being subsumed or created through the process of publishing and distribution, as is often the case with internet ‘collage’. Computers conceal distance; their collage move consists of juxtaposing elements that might be stored hundreds or thousands of miles apart, giving an illusion of spatial continuity. (Seth Price, <em><a href="http://artfcity.com/2009/10/22/img-mgmt-teen-image/">Teen Image</a></em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Traditional art collage used the intrigue and power in composing elements pulled from diverse sources. Meaning constructed by selection, editing, and combination. The HTML collage, however, is copy-pasted. What is the HTML-native collage?</p>

<p><img src="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/7982/original_alt.png" alt="Alt by Charles Broskoski"></p>

<p>I call it the “Arrangement Collage”—rectangular, transcontextual compositions of, ostensibly, found media. The arrangement collage does less work for the viewer than traditional collage: elements are kept fully intact rather than trimmed for blended. The composition often mitigates interaction between elements and instead celebrates raw adjacency.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the historical avant-garde used valorized cultural objects such as the <em>Mona Lisa</em> or a violin, it profaned, overpowered, and destroyed them before going on to aestheticize them. In contrast, contemporary art uses mass-cultural things virtually intact. (Boris Groys, <em>On The New</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The arrangement collage, while easy to construct in print, is truly native to the web, in which all objects are, by default, level rectangles, context-switching is the norm, and media to compose with is bountiful.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/HewxiKI.jpg" alt="JJJJound Screenshot"></p>

<p>Our feeds, plentiful in the digital landscape, help populate the arrangement collage. Tumblr, ostensibly a micro-blogging site, is largely used for <a href="http://hyperallergic.com/66038/the-teen-girl-tumblr-aesthetic/">image collection</a>; FFFFound is build around a contextless stream of collected imagery (and as birthing the name for JJJJound, when Justin Saunders couldn’t get an account); and Buzzfeed publishes “articles” that are frankly just stacks of image macros. A proliferation of mindless image consumption <a href="http://www.itsnicethat.com/features/bob-gill-interview">concerns Bob Gill</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s nothing original. ‘The Culture’ is the great mass of images and ideas which bombard us every day, and therefore shape the way we think visually. Only by recognising The Culture’s presence and its power, can designers move away from the clichés it promotes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Irrefutably, the images we consume affect how we think, and what we can imagine. Gill’s words should be considered, and the internet-native should stay aware of “the clichés” promoted. Gill encourages “first-hand” research, but this points at a cultural gap—there is no line between reality and the internet; “first-hand” research takes place on the social web. In-person discussion and close examination of physical objects can be romanticized, but it should not detract from the fact that meaningful discussion and critical consumption can happen in a digital landscape as well.</p>

<p>Of deeper concern is the stripping of value from imagery in overabundance. Edition MK’s 2010 <em>DDDDoomed</em> (the name, I assume, another reference to FFFFound) gets at the kernel of this problem: Image Aggregators (“IAs”—such as JJJJound and other blogs), which typically present images contextless alongside hundreds of others, can strip imagery of its power. IAs do work that is weaker, semiotically, than traditional collage, and less organized than archiving (which is often a process of attaching or generating metadata, whereas IAs frequently remove it). Images that find political power within a context are reduced to purely aesthetic objects in the stream.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We [distance ourselves] from our critical faculties as we slide into models of passive spectatorship that reinforce our passivity by promoting a one-way mode of cultural consumption. […] Continuous over-stimulation leads to desensitisation. (Peter Buwert, “Defamiliarization, Brecht and Criticality in Graphic Design” in <em>Modes of Criticism 2: Critique of Method</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The arrangement collage might serve as a tool in this battle against desensitization. In Buwert’s essay, referenced above, he describes how Brecht’s famous defamiliarization of the theater encouraged “a condition of active critical spectatorship within the audience.” <em>DDDDoomed</em> is lamenting the supposed death of this critical spectator, replaced with the numb and passive viewer. Buwert is less concerned with context/lessness than Edition MK, and instead focuses on familiarity.</p>

<p><img src="https://process.filepicker.io/AJdAgnqCST4iPtnUxiGtTz/rotate=deg:exif/rotate=deg:0/resize=width:960,fit:crop/output=format:jpg,compress:true,quality:95/https://d1qz9pzgo5wm5k.cloudfront.net/api/file/AqaYcXNRoCPLyVehNHqR" alt="Rollercoaster print sweater by Raf Simons"></p>

<p>There are valiant efforts towards an inclusion of context and metadata with online imagery, but it is not built into the structure of the internet. Flickr and twitter use image covers to dissuade copy-pasting (circumnavigable by screen-shotting) and <a href="http://www.mediachain.io/">Mediachain</a> attempts to inextricably tie media to metadata using blockchain methods. As of writing, however, the JPG is not going anywhere, and the ease of downloading and re-uploading an image far surpasses digging to find its source. Entropy is not on our side, and Google’s reverse image search will never be quite fast or comprehensive enough to keep up.</p>

<p>Walter Benjamin might lament the loss of contextual sensitivity, as it comes intertwined with a loss of “aura.” The authenticity that drives Benjamin’s aura is dependent on the idea of an original—which, in internet ecosystems, simply isn’t a relevant concept, as the original and reproduction can be identical both in themselves and conceivably in context. The arrangement collage can construct an internal aura and context regardless of future reproduction or repurposing, where the included images serve as referents to the others—even if the metadata of the .JPG is long gone. I believe the battle for context inclusion has been lost, but efforts to stimulate the viewer’s sense of familiarity can still bear fruit.</p>

<p>A critical spectator is an active spectator, firstly. Thankfully, the barrier to entry for participating in digital image culture lowers by the day. If construction of streams—enabled by sites like tumblr—seems too passive, I think construction of collage engages the composer at a more intentional level. Easy-to-use platforms such as <a href="http://to.be">to.be</a>, <a href="http://newhive.com/">newhive</a>, and <a href="https://amb-1.com/">AMB-1</a> indicate desire for arrangement collage composition tools. It is partly the job of thoughtful, critical collagists-cum-spectators to construct collages “out of a messy array of found fragments” that shake a sense of familiarity amongst our banal streams.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/f2o5JlS.jpg" alt="Example to.be field"></p>

<p>When the means of production for collage are accessible to the viewer, “these narratives are encountered as just one way of viewing [the media], and the constructed and interpreted nature of reality is exposed” (Buwert in <em>Modes of Criticism 2</em>). With extremely low-barrier-to-entry tools, any collage that catches the viewers notice can be considered an opportunity to remix further. Even just the consideration of how a collage was collected prompts questions that create the critical spectator. The source of the images may be lost, but the ability for them to be reconsidered and repurposed again is further engaged. The arrangement collage, along with simple tools for their creation, can be celebrated and pushed as a tool for enabling creators and stirring image consumers out of their typical feeds, a jolt out of Gill’s “culture.”</p>

<p>The arrangement collage can be in HTML proper or a common image file. If in HTML, it is simple to fragment a collage into individual images and text, and as an image, Windows Paint, Preview.app, and the aforementioned online services make decomposition trivial. The collages themselves thus become part of the churn of images on the internet, as can their components—all of it folded back into the image ecosystem, and the remix-curation loop comes full circle. It’s as close as we’ll come to dust-to-dust in digital objects.</p>

<p>The arrangement collage is an internet-native and relatively democratized tool for people to weave personal narrative through a volume of imagery. As we wade through monotonous, contextless image collections, articulations of taste and statement might become harder to uncover. These discrete paintings are built for the web, and when approached seriously, can empower makers to inspire a critical spectator.</p>
