            <div id="description">
                <p>One of my major reasons for attending Brown University is because I was excited about <a href="http://stemtosteam.org">STEAM</a>.</p>

<p>I found friends and mentors in two like-minded classmates, Hanna McPhee and Michelle Site. With them at the helm, the three of us launched <a href="http://brownsteam.org">Brown STEAM</a>, as a partner group to <a href="http://risdsteam.org">RISD STEAM</a>. We saught to provide a home for people whose interests and projects found them caught between the restrictive disciplinary boundaries of a modern research university, and to espouse the importance of interdisciplinary thinking in the working world.</p>

<p>I acted as VP for two semesters, took a break for another, and am now back as a Senior Advisor for the group. I have helped with advising, administrative duties, logistics, event implementation, and web design (along with <a href="http://cath.land">Cath Schmidt</a>). My biggest event  for the 2013-2014 school year was getting mathematician/sculptor/professor <a href="http://georgehart.com">George Hart</a> to Brown. He gave a lecture, workshop, and installed a hanging orb sculpture in the Engineering/Physics building on campus. Many thanks to Brown STEAM, The Division of Applied Mathematics, the School of Engineering, and the Physics Department for their support.</p>

<p>In Spring 2013 I started a group to partner teach at the <a href="http://jcdsri.org">Jewish Community Day School Rhode Island</a>, to teach STEAM principles to students at a younger age.</p>
