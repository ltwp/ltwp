## [Cartography, Place, and Identity in Video Games](http://ltwp.net/stuff/vg_cartography.pdf).

For my final project in a cartographic history class at RISD, taught by Dr Christina Connett, I wrote an essay about spatial representation in video games and its ramifications in allowing for player in-game identity creation. I consider it one of my better research papers in college and opened my eyes to further rabbit holes of critical theory. Spring 2013.
