name: Return Maps & Chaos in 2-Bus Loop

words1:

In Spring 2014 I took a class about chaos and nonlinear dynamics with Dr John Gemmer. As a final project, I sought to recreate the results from Nagatani’s 2006 paper “Chaos control and schedule of shuttle buses.” 

With little documentation of his code, I recreated a system in MATLAB and found my own results. Read the paper at [ltwp.net/stuff/return_maps.pdf](http://ltwp.net/stuff/return_maps.pdf).

My investigation showed that headway behavior takes a finite set of canonical forms, but more investigation is needed to make sure the types I delineate are actually all discrete.
