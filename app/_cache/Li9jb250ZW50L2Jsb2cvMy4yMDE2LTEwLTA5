        <p>I'm going to leave twitter. I have toyed with this idea for years, and vaguely attempted it a few times, but now it's necessary.</p>

<p>It's amazing anyone gets anything done, to me. I want to follow everything, consume everything I see. I can spend all day reading articles and books and watching things people recommend, only to end the day with some thoughts in my head and eyes pained by a long day at a screen.</p>

<p>I know that unless I make something, I don't synthesize. I have to write to understand, and build to see how something works. (For this reason I've started writing a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-nazAYHmrM3OjfxIDBB69S5DphIVbwuuOpT_8-l6Q58/edit#gid=0">short summary of everything I read</a> that takes more than ~15minutes.)</p>

<p>Attempts to keep up with the consumption and interests of my friends is stripping me of time to develop and pursue my own interests. (They obviously aren't mutually exclusive, though!)</p>

<p>I don't even have a very good filter between "what's interesting/relevant" to me and what isn't. And I don't want to change this—I think it helps me <a href="http://ltwp.net/interviews/?/joshua/">celebrate the things at my periphery</a> and keep a broad perspective on my work.</p>

<p>Pulling myself off twitter hurts for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have met tons of amazing people and keep in touch with many through the site.</p></li>
<li><p>Twitter enables dissemination &amp; construction of digital work in an intuitive mode.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But, in response:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I feel secure in my network right now. I feel comfortable, for the first time in 5 years, getting out of a "meeting people" mode.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't want to be involved so much in short-term media content cycles. Time on twitter makes me feel like I can't construct a thought longer than a few tweets. While I know this is by no means unique to me, and that media is both crucial and inescapable, there are many who seem to navigate it in a healthier way.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am part of a digital city and hope to leave the <a href="https://www.edge.org/conversation/monica_l_smith-infrastructure-as-dialogue">infrastructural engagement</a> of public-construction to other members of the commons. Perhaps people who enjoy it, or get paid for it.</p>

<p>The projects that are most fulfilling to me are long-term finite products. Making my pneumatic bubble, developing the space of the BDW, publishing a research paper. I want to reclaim a longer wavelength in my thinking patterns, something that I feel twitter actively chips away at.</p>

<p>I might still announce some projects on here as they come, but if you want to chat, send me an email! lukaswinklerprins@gmail.com.</p>
