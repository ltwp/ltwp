            <p>I went to high school at <a href="http://cranbrook.edu">Cranbrook Kingswood</a>, an amazing place that gave me enormous appreciation for the arts. I was lucky enough to have a world-class art museum literally in my backyard, and in my final years of high school I became a docent there.</p>

<p>And so, too, in my last two years of college. The <a href="http://risdmuseum.org">RISD Museum</a> is an amazing institution with an enormous collection to boot. I see docenting as a way for me to engage with art history and practice my public speaking, in addition to teaching people how awesome art museums are.</p>

<p>I have designed two tours, using objects from the permanent collection:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The Touch of the Artist</em>, focusing on remnants of artists' gestures in their work and what it means.</li>
<li><em>The Mathematician's Museum</em>, an examination of similarities in the investigations of artists and mathematicians.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have delivered each of these tours upwards of five times to groups of various size, age range, background, and interest.</p>

<p>My third tour is in-progress.</p>
