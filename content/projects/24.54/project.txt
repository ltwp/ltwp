My friends Kristen Wentrcek and Andrew Zebulon organized a show, [NYCxSkymall](http://wintercheckfactory.com/projects/5-nycxskymall), an "exhibition of design solutions for problems that don't exist," and invited me to contribute. 

3-hour intended performance, cut short due to travel issues. Watch a [video of $54 on vimeo here](https://vimeo.com/177604584).
