# Research

I am a scientist with applied interests and a love for teaching, currently working as a postdoctoral scholar at the [Environmental Systems Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.esdlberkeley.com/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I got my Ph.D from the same university, where I worked closely with Dr Mark Stacey and Dr Jessie Lacy (USGS) on hydrodynamics and sediment transport in shallow bays and marshlands. My bachelors is in Applied Mathematics from Brown University. 

My scholarship focuses on the following as relevant to wetlands, estuaries, bays, and beaches: 

- environmental fluid mechanics and coastal physical oceanography
- the transport and fate of water and sediment (then carbon, gases, plastics...)
- how hydrodynamics are co-produced with geomorphic and ecological change

These questions frequently intersect with infrastructure systems and human impacts, leading me to both engineering or humanistic work. I am excited to think interdisciplinarily whenever possible! 

I work primarily as a field scientist, trying to make effective use of environmental sensors and observations. To extend the application of these findings, I connect in-situ observations to larger spatiotemporal scales using remote sensing techniques and numerical models.

Outside of technical questions, I am energized by cultural theory and historical ecology around bodies of water and infrastructure. Outreach to younger folks is important to me, and I channel my energy mostly through <a href="https://www.citysurfproject.com/">City Surf Project</a> in San Francisco.
