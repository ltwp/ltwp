description:

In Spring 2014 I was in an [experimental web design class](http://ltwp.net/projects/output) and was thinking about multimedia experiences within the allowances of scrolling in the web browser. This poem (if I can call it that) is the result. Published by the now-defunct Recess Journal; many thanks to Kate Groetzinger and Koji Yamamoto for letting me break their web platform.
