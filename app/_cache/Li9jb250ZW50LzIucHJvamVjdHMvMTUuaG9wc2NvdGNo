            <p>I think it was in Spring 2014 that my friend <a href="http://nathanzack.net">Nate</a> came to me and told me he thought there was a hole in the market for mid-priced womens overalls. We, half-jokingly, talked about starting a brand, making a pair, and then fell back into our schoolwork and summer jobs.</p>

<p>But we kept talking about this ideaâ€”a certain aesthetic, the literary woman, a level of comfort and cozy, urban spaces and rural lineage. Lines in space and arrangements of textures. We kept finding ourselves looking at images of overalls.</p>

<p>Finally, in January 2015, we sprung. We were excited to learn how to construct a garment out of fabric, to define a look, a feel, and to make design decisions that start to construct a brand.</p>

<p>It took us 5 months, but we made a pair of real, denim overalls. Thanks to <a href="http://laylamayehsan.com">Layla</a> for her paitience and amazing modeling skills. Thanks to the <a href="http://www.brown.edu/research/projects/design-workshop/about-us">BDW</a> for their sewing machine and generous table space. Thank you <a href="jjord.com">Jordan</a> for his excellent photography.</p>

<p>More photos, and a website, to come.</p>
