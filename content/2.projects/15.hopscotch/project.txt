I think it was in Spring 2014 that my friend [Nate](http://nathanzack.net) came to me and told me he thought there was a hole in the market for mid-priced womens overalls. We, half-jokingly, talked about starting a brand, making a pair, and then fell back into our schoolwork and summer jobs.

But we kept talking about this ideaâ€”a certain aesthetic, the literary woman, a level of comfort and cozy, urban spaces and rural lineage. Lines in space and arrangements of textures. We kept finding ourselves looking at images of overalls.

Finally, in January 2015, we sprung. We were excited to learn how to construct a garment out of fabric, to define a look, a feel, and to make design decisions that start to construct a brand.

It took us 5 months, but we made a pair of real, denim overalls. Thanks to [Layla](http://laylamayehsan.com) for her paitience and amazing modeling skills. Thanks to the [BDW](http://www.brown.edu/research/projects/design-workshop/about-us) for their sewing machine and generous table space. Thank you [Jordan](jjord.com) for his excellent photography.
