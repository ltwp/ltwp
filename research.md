# Research

I am a scientist with a love for teaching, currently working as a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Physical Geography at Stockholms Universitet. I got my Ph.D from the University of California, Berkeley, where I worked closely with Dr Mark Stacey and Dr Jessie Lacy (USGS) on hydrodynamics and sediment transport in shallow bays and marshlands. I then did a one-year postdoc, also at UC Berkeley, in Laurel Larsen's Environmental Systems Dynamics Group. My bachelors is in Applied Mathematics from Brown University. 

My scholarship focuses on the following as relevant to wetlands, estuaries, bays, and beaches: 

- environmental fluid mechanics, coastal engineering, and physical oceanography
- the transport and fate of stuff moved by water: sediment, nutrients, plastics, etc.
- how hydrodynamics are co-produced with geomorphic (and ecological) change
- novel techniques for observing and representing all of the above

These questions frequently intersect with infrastructure systems and concerns of human stewardship. I aim to think interdisciplinarily and humanistically!

I work primarily as a field scientist, trying to make effective use of environmental sensors and observations. To extend the application of these findings, I connect in-situ observations to larger spatiotemporal scales using remote sensing techniques and numerical models.

Outside of technical questions, I am energized by cultural theory and historical ecology around bodies of water and infrastructure. Outreach to younger folks is important to me, and I am looking for ways to do so in Stockholm right now. 

<!-- I channel my energy mostly through <a href="https://www.citysurfproject.com/">City Surf Project</a> and <a href="https://wildoysters.org/">Wild Oyster Project</a> in San Francisco.
I support degrowth-oriented and citizen-centered environmental science, management, and activism. This requires good pedagogy, low-impact/cost methods, small-group organizing, long-term monitoring, and capable institutions.  -->
