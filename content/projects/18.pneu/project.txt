During the 2014-2015 school year, [Brown STEAM](http://steamwith.us) started collaborating with local company [Pneuhaus](http://pneuha.us), developing a plan to commission a large-scale bubble for the student group to use as a flexible and transportable programming space.

In the planning and research phases of this project, I found myself excited about the technical details of pneumatic structures.

I took this interest to Dr Chris Bull in the School of Engineering and developed an independent study for me to study Pneumatic Architecture.

The semester consisted of a crash-course in solid mechanics, pneumatic engineering, and finite element methods. All that before actually sitting down and designing, then constructing, my own inflatable pneumatic structure.

I call my structure the "igloo." It is a 2/3rds sphere in the form of a geodesic dome, made out of 1.9oz ripstop Nylon.

Please watch an [inflation video](https://vimeo.com/144995572)!.

Big thanks to Pneuhaus, Dr Bull, Alex Hadik, and many other friends for their help and support over the course of this project.
