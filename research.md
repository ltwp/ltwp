# Research

I am a scientist/engineer with a love for teaching, currently working as a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Physical Geography at Stockholms Universitet with Fernando Jaramillo. I got my Ph.D from the University of California, Berkeley, where I worked with the U.S. Geological Survey on hydrodynamics and sediment transport in shallow bays and marshlands together with Mark Stacey and Jessie Lacy. I then did a one-year postdoc, also at Berkeley, in Laurel Larsen's Environmental Systems Dynamics Group. My bachelors is in Applied Mathematics from Brown University.

My scholarship focuses on the following:

- environmental fluid mechanics and physical oceanography of wetlands, estuaries, and bays 
- the transport and fate of matter in these environments: sediment, carbon, plastics, etc.
- how hydrodynamics are co-produced with geomorphic (and ecological) change
- novel techniques for observing and representing all of the above

These questions frequently intersect with infrastructure systems and concerns of human stewardship. I aim to think interdisciplinarily and humanistically!

I work primarily as a field scientist, trying to make effective use of environmental sensors and observations. To extend the application of these findings, I connect in-situ observations to larger spatiotemporal scales using remote sensing techniques and numerical models.

Outside of technical questions, I am energized by cultural theory and historical ecology around bodies of water and infrastructure. Outreach to young people and those who live near the water I study is important to me, and I am looking for ways to do so in Stockholm right now. 

<!-- I channel my energy mostly through <a href="https://www.citysurfproject.com/">City Surf Project</a> and <a href="https://wildoysters.org/">Wild Oyster Project</a> in San Francisco.
I support degrowth-oriented and citizen-centered environmental science, management, and activism. This requires good pedagogy, low-impact/cost methods, small-group organizing, long-term monitoring, and capable institutions.  -->
