I have wide interests and can generally find anything interesting. 
That said, there are some recurring topics. These include, in no order:

- environmental hydrodynamics
- resilience of infrastructure and organizations
- effective metrics, especially in extreme value scenarios
- geomorphology, especially regarding sediment dynamics
- effective pedagogy, in and beyond institutions
- conceptual and performance art, at the edge of sculpture
- surfing
- theory and practice of the built environment
- community-run spaces
- poetry, especially short/minimal poems
