# Research

I am a researcher, currently as a PhD student under Mark Stacey in UC Berkeley's <a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/">CEE</a>. I am partially supported via the US Geological Survey, working with federal scientists out of the Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center.  I enjoy collaborating with people in different places and disciplines. 

At the broadest scale, I am interested in change in coastal systems. More specifically, I am interested in:

- hydrodynamics and sediment transport in estuaries
- geomorphology and restoration engineering in estuaries
- mathematical analysis of estuarine physics and risk
- effective use of in-situ sensors 

I work primarily as a field scientist, but working on larger spatial and temporal timescales using remote sensing and modeling applications is crucial. 

Outside of technical questions, I am energized by the epistemology of human-environment relations, the social relations of infrastructure, and historical ecology around estuaries and bays. I am keen to celebrate citizen-scale participation in environmental management and action.
