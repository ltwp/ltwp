# Research

I am a scientist with applied interests and a desire to teach, currently working as a postdoctoral scholar at the [Environmental Systems Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.esdlberkeley.com/) at the University of California, Berkeley. I got my Ph.D from the same university, where I worked closely with Dr Mark Stacey and Dr Jessie Lacy (USGS) on hydrodynamics and sediment transport in shallow bays and marshlands. 

My scholarship focuses on the following:

- environmental fluid mechanics and physical processes of wetlands, estuaries, bays, and coastal oceans
- how hydrodynamics are co-produced with geomorphic or ecological change
- the transport and fate of sediment, carbon, plastic, and more...

These questions frequently intersect with infrastructure systems and human impacts, leading me to both engineering or humanistic work. I am excited to think interdisciplinarily whenever possible! 

I work primarily as a field scientist, trying to make effective use of environmental sensors and observations. To extend the application of these findings, I connect in-situ observations to larger spatiotemporal scales using remote sensing techniques and numerical models.

Outside of technical questions, I am energized by cultural theory and historical ecology around bodies of water and infrastructure. Outreach to younger folks is important to me, and I channel my energy mostly through <a href="https://www.citysurfproject.com/">City Surf Project</a> in San Francisco.
