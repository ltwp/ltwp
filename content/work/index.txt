I was a founding monitor at the [Brown Design Workshop](http://www.browndesignworkshop.org/) before coming a manager and then the first dedicated staff member—the Development Coordinator. 

Along with [Nathan Zack](http://nathanzack.net), I co-founded Hopscotch, a small experiment in women's overalls (with an accompanying scarf line). 

In Spring 2016 I [interviewed a bunch of my friends](http://ltwp.net/interviews/) on how they were starting their careers in creative fields. 

I [performed my piece '$54'](https://vimeo.com/177604584) at NYCxSKYMALL, and a jumping [performance piece](https://vimeo.com/152009073) in 2015.
