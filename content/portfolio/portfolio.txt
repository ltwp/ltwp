I'm an experimental front-end designer/developer with experience working in a variety of CMS and static-site systems alongside mixed javascript libraries.

I'm a quick learner and focus on making sites that empower the user&mdash;if you don't see what you like, I'm sure we can make it happen.

I'm best-suited for portfolio websites, playful web-native experiments, web-to-print workflows, and setting up blogs.
