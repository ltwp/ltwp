# Research

I am a researcher and educator, with a Ph.D from the University of California. There, I worked closely with Dr Mark Stacey (UC Berkeley) and Dr Jessie Lacy (USGS) on hydrodynamics and sediment transport in shallow bays and marshlands. 

My interests are on how waters in bays, estuaries, and coastal regions move stuff around (especially sediment). Thus, I study: 

- estuarine hydrodynamics and coastal physical oceanography
- how hydrodynamics drive sedimentation patterns and geomorphology in coastal regions 
- transport and fate of sediment, carbon, or other particulate-bound substances

These questions frequently intersect with infrastructure systems/risk, ecological networks, and human communities; I am excited to do interdisciplinary work whenever possible! 

I work primarily as a field scientist, trying to make effective use of environmental sensors and observations. To extend the application of these findings, I connect in-situ observations to larger spatiotemporal scales using remote sensing techniques and numerical models.

Outside of technical questions, I am energized by cultural theory and historical ecology around bodies of water and infrastructure. I support degrowth-oriented and citizen-centered environmental science, management, and activism. This requires good pedagogy, low-impact/cost methods, small-group organizing, long-term monitoring, and capable institutions. I love doing outreach to younger folks and channel my energy mostly through <a href="https://www.citysurfproject.com/">City Surf Project</a> in San Francisco.
