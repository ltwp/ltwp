This is a silly thought, and me testing [mathjax](http://mathjax.org) on my website.

I always feel like I have enough toilet paper, and then suddenly I don't. The roll looks ripe and fine, then one day mid-dookie it becomes suddenly empty. There has to be a reason for this.

It makes some sense. I judge the amount of toilet paper left largely by the area of paper I can see when I view the roll down the tube. The are of a circle is of course related to r&sup2;, where r is the radius. Radius is a linear quantity, and we pull paper off the roll in a linear way. But I was judging how "full" the roll was by something non-linear. A quick calculation confirms this.

Let's define some variables.

_t_ for time. _r_ for the radius of the roll. _T_ for the thickness of the paper. And _l_ for the length of paper remaining on the roll.

$$ r=r(t) $$
$$ r(0) = R $$

Assuming our roll is solid (has no cardboard tube), the area of the circular part of the tube, time the thickness of the paper _T_, gives us the length of the role at any moment in time, _l(t)_.

$$ l(t) = \frac{\pi r^2}{T} $$

Now, let's assume I use toilet paper at a constant rate. We can write this as:

$$ \frac{dl}{dt} = -\alpha = \frac{d}{dt}(\frac{\pi r^2}{T}) = \frac{dr}{dt} \frac{2\pi r}{T} $$

Thus we can find our rate of radial change.

$$ \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{-\alpha T}{2\pi} * \frac{1}{r} $$

Now we can rearrange and solve.

$$ \frac{dr}{dt} r = \frac{-\alpha T}{2\pi} \Rightarrow \int \frac{dr}{dt} r \,dt = \frac{-\alpha T}{2\pi} \int\,dt \Rightarrow \frac{r^2}{2} + C = \frac{-\alpha T}{2\pi}*t $$

And so we find our equation for _r(t)_:

$$ r(t) = \sqrt{\frac{-\alpha T}{\pi}*t + C} $$

With our initial condition of _r(0)=R_, we find

$$ r(t) = \sqrt{\frac{-\alpha T}{\pi}*t + R^2} $$

Which looks about like this, according to Wolfram|Alpha:

See that hockey-stick behavior? As time goes on, taking toilet paper at a constant rate, the radius will start to decrease faster and faster. My intuition was correct about this.

But I was wrong about judging the fullness of the roll by area. If we square this equation, it becomes linear, so with time the area decreases at a linear rate. I guess my eyes trust the linear measurement more.

Anyway, keep a spare roll or two under the sink.
