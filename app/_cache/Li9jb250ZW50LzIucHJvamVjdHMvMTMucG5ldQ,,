            <p>During the 2014-2015 school year, Brown STEAM started collaborating with local company <a href="http://pneuha.us">Pneuhaus</a>, developing a plan to commission a large-scale bubble for the student group to use as a flexible and transportable programming space.</p>

<p>In the planning and research phases of this project, I found myself excited about the technical details of pneumatic structures: the engineering details, as well as physical construction. I took this interest to Dr Chris Bull in the School of Engineering and developed an independent study for me to study Pneumatic Architecture.</p>

<p>The semester consisted of a crash-course in solid mechanics, pneumatic engineering, and finite element methods. All that before actually sitting down and designing, then constructing, my own inflatable pneumatic structure.</p>

<p>I call my structure the "igloo." It is a 2/3rds sphere in the form of a geodesic dome, made out of 1.9oz ripstop Nylon.</p>

<p>Big thanks to Pneuhaus, Dr Bull, Alex Hadik, and many other friends for their help and support over the course of this project. More documentation forthcoming.</p>
