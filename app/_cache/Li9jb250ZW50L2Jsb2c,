        <p><em>Stewart Brand's <a href="https://www.are.na/block/325214">Timescales of civilization</a> - from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Buildings_Learn">How Buildings Learn</a></em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.e-flux.com/journal/77/76215/institutional-liberation/">Institutional Liberation</a> on e-flux hit me hard. It touches on public lack of identification with our institutions and the collective agency stripped from us by neoliberal-fueled individualism.</p>

<p>It made me ask, "what institutions do I identify with?" Which naturally lead to, "what is an institution, anyway?"</p>

<p>The denotation is an organization of people founded towards a shared purpose. An institution as crystallized ideology. This definition, however, fails to bring along the inertia and scale that the word "Institution" connotes. Institutions typically act on the "governance" and "culture" scales in Brand's breakdown above (the ordering of which I don't entirely agree with, but it's OK).</p>

<p>I suppose this is exactly the problem. Many institutions—think universities, large museums, ubiquitous multinationals, etc—are operating at a level of scale abstraction that makes them unintelligible and out-of-sync with the needs and desires of humans.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nothing is possible without men, but nothing lasts without institutions. (Jean Monnet)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just as the termite colony needs its members to exist but also sacrifices swaths of its population in times of need, our institutions are made out of people yet might not always value the identities of those constituents. One actor in the institution might not understand how its actions contribute to the whole. You could call an institution an ideologically-driven <a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2016/02/11/minimum-viable-superorganism/">superorganism</a>.</p>

<p>Now, again, which institutions do I identify with? I appreciate my alma mater but not enough to truly value its continued survival. (Schools like Black Mountain College, Cooper Union, and some of <a href="https://www.are.na/lukas-wp/experimental-schooling-institutions">these Experimental Schooling Institutions</a> are more inspiring to me.)</p>

<p>In Providence, I loved making regular visits to the RISD Museum. As a student and then, after I graduated, volunteer, I had free entry. In the case of the larger museum, free entry can completely change how you interact with it; I was happy to swing by for 5 minutes on my walk into downtown just to see the wooden Buddha. There was no guilt about getting my money's worth or otherwise.</p>

<p>Last year I gifted my mother a membership to the <a href="http://www.phillipscollection.org/">Phillips Collection</a> in DC—a smaller, private museum, and much-needed respite from the insanity of the nearby Smithsonians. She can go any time without extra charge and make it her own quieter space. If you have the opportunity to become a member at a local museum, I recommend you take it.</p>

<p>In New York I love <a href="http://www.mmuseumm.com/">Mmuseumm</a>. The idea that a museum can be tiny, easy-to-access, and in-touch with its membership is unfortunately rare, as the big ones continue to grow and diffuse (think the MoMA, the Met, the Whitney) and the mid-size shrivels. Can we not renew a focus on approachable, small-to-medium-scale museums and, more broadly, institutions?</p>

<p><a href="http://theartnewspaper.com/comment/comment/orhan-pamuk-s-manifesto-for-museums/">Orham Pamuk agrees</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is imperative that museums become smaller, more orientated towards the individual and more economical. This is the only way that they can ever tell stories on a human scale. The great museums invite us to forget our humanity and to accept the state and its human masses. This is why there are millions, outside the West, who are frightened by museums. This is why museums are associated with governments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have yet to get a grasp on the museum scene in Los Angeles. The Broad is too fancy, the Getty too big, LACMA too stolid. I'd like to find a museum I love and make some institutional attachments.</p>

        <p>In the slosh of the past few months I've developed a newfound appreciation for rituals. I've always appreciated habit, but near the end of college many of my structured patterns dissolved, and it's only now, a year and a half later, that I'm rebuilding.</p>

<p>The two new consistencies are daily meditation and regular surfing. Both have been emotional stabilizers as I've navigated the stresses of not having consistent places to sleep, jobs to work, or people to connect with. The only bad habit I've lapsed back into is abundant stress-eating. Alas.</p>

<p>(I now, finally, have an apartment.)</p>

<p>Surfing is truly wonderful. I've been a swimmer for as long as I can remember and grew to love the consistency of a chlorinated pool. Now the dynamics of the ocean are appreciated and I'm trying to tune in to the philosophy of the sport.</p>

<p>There's some nasty machismo and territorialism out there, but largely surfing is an easy-going sport. (The defensiveness over beaches can be justified by a more and more crowded scene, but is discouraging as a beginner.) <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1992/08/24/playing-docs-games-part-one">This New Yorker Piece on Surfing with 'Doc' Mark Renneker</a> goes deep and conveys well the patience necessary for surfing. Unless you're surfing on quick, small waves, much of the sport is patience. Patience in the weather and swell, patience in paddling out, in positioning, in timing.</p>

<p>On a beach break especially (the less-predictable type of break), your position is never ideal. It's a neverending case of grass-is-greener. The folks on either side of you are catching better waves and the moment you get one, well, you aren't thinking about it, you're just riding it. There's a certain passivity the surfer has to nurture so as to not tire themselves out, chasing the best wave up-and-down the beach. The best wave is just the next one you  catch.</p>

<p>If you conceptualize surfing as a kind of wave-based dancing, then it is just as ephemeral a medium. (It's always been interesting to me that dancing has defied attempts at standardized archival notation systems.) Either you got the wave or you didn't, and this breeds an easy-going nature. I routinely feel guilty as I flail around and get in the path of more experienced surfers, but they rarely get angry.</p>

<p>Attention to the other surfers is important, but more is to keep your eyes on the waves. Too often do I get distracted trying to see others, or watch the beach, only to miss a great wave or get eaten up by one that snuck up on me. Distraction yields immediate repercussions.</p>

<p>A few years ago I read <a href="http://www.freundevonfreunden.com/workplaces/azuma-makoto/">this FvF interview with Azuma Mokoto</a> and his reasoning for why he worked with flowers alone has stuck with me profoundly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I guess I am not interested in things that will leave something behind. Flowers are not forever, they last for a certain amount of time and that thought feeds my creativity. It’s very different from, for example, catching a moment in a photograph. It is more about meeting this particular flower with this particular feeling and the fact that I meet this flower in a particular moment, that is what fascinates me and that is why I think I use flowers as my medium of choice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a time of exploitating the art object as capital investment and mass consumerism, I joyously get behind ephemeral work. Surfing is an art that exists in the moment and memory alone—surf photography only flirts with what it actually looks and feels like on the waves. (<a href="http://acidsurfing.com/">Acid Surfing</a> has some lovely creative photo work, though, cutting through the ranks of the <a href="https://www.surfersjournal.com/">established</a> <a href="http://www.surfermag.com/">publications</a>).</p>

<p>And, ultimately, you are in the ocean. This morning, sitting on my board, two dolphins swam past, maybe only 30 feet away. I've seen fish, rays, and various oceanic birds. These animals, the ebb-and-flow of Angelinos, alongside the fog, winds, and tides all build towards a broader appreciation of the patterns of this planet.</p>

<p>On the worst possible day, surfing gives me some exercise and sunshine. On the ideal day, there's a mix of adrenaline and relaxation; a meditative celebration of whatever fleeting waves I can find; and a oneness with all others in the ocean with me.</p>

<p>Let me know if you are in Southern California, and we can give it a go.</p>

        <p>Driving South on the 110 last week, just beyond downtown Los Angeles, I turned to my left and saw a spread of bright lights floating in the dark sky. I did a double-take, and meditated on what they could be all the way home. My first guess was telecom poles in a loose formation of pairs running East-West. But the lights were too high-altitude. I seriously entertained the idea of UFOs, or some military flights tests.</p>

<p>I saw it again tonight, and thanks light from the supermoon, it was clear that the lights actually belong to civilian airplanes. Given LAX's major runways run East-West, I realized these are <a href="http://webtrak5.bksv.com/lax4">incoming flights and planes in holding patterns</a>.</p>

<p>Los Angeles is a city designed to be enjoyed by car, but it's fun to think of cities that are fun by airplane. I always thrill when landing in Washington Reagan, where I always feel like you get to fly a little <em>too</em> close to the Pentagon. If you're stuck in a holding pattern for hours over Los Angeles, I imagined you can parse the various grids and the topology that disturbs them, the dotting of bright urban centers woven throughout. The flight pattern provides a structured window through which to see the city.</p>

<p>I was reminded of a <a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/objects/6116_underlay_for_the_new_york_birdcage_imaginary_architecture">Friedrich St. Florian drawing in the RISD Museum's permanent collection</a>, <em>Underlay for the New York Birdcage - Imaginary Architecture</em>:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IpLnsla.jpg" alt="Underlay for the New York Birdcage - Imaginary Architecture"></p>

<p>Florian condenses the temporal variable of incoming NY-area flights into a static document, constructing imagined spaces out of flight traffic patterns. This is a graph in a canonical sense; a visualized dynamic by chosen variables. There just happens to be a map of New York City underlying the whole thing.</p>

<p>Junior year of college I wrote <a href="http://ltwp.net/stuff/return_maps.pdf">a paper on chaotic patterns in distance between two buses in a closed loop</a>. It was a basic invocation of chaos out of an extremely simplified traffic scenario, and as I traverse Los Angeles I think a lot about traffic flow modeling.</p>

<p>Traffic can be modeled like a granular fluid flow much of the time, but the key differences that makes it difficult, naturally, are that there are encoded social norms to driving. For example, the left lane is used for longer distances and higher speeds while trucks going 55mph stick in the right lane. All of this has to be built into your model if you want to achieve some level of realism. I think some traffic modeling will be the first application of my newfound python skills. I've just about finished <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">the book</a> and am getting tired of the author's condescending tone.</p>

<p>In an introductory nonlinear dynamics course, the first mention of "chaotic" dynamics often comes alongside the idea of a <a href="http://geoffboeing.com/2015/03/chaos-theory-logistic-map/">Poincaré Plot</a>, which, just as Florian's drawing, condenses multiple points of temporal data into a few visualized spatial dimensions.</p>

<p>My attraction to fluids has always been fueled by the richness of their complexity—vast typologies of behavior out of just a few parameters for adjustment. We use visuals as our best attempt at learning from slices of the vast spatio-temporal spaces of these dynamics.</p>

<p>I excitedly picked up <a href="http://store.bgc.bard.edu/the-islands-of-benoit-mandelbrot-fractals-chaos-and-the-materiality-of-thinking-edited-by-nina-samuel/">The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking</a> about two years ago and recently revisited. It's still fun to look through, but unfortunately the book falls a bit flat of its audacious title.</p>

<p>The authors and editor take an art-historic approach to Mandelbrot's early computer visualizations of fractals, which is a lovely perspective on top of the technical value of the drawings. But, they fail to do enough mathematics themselves to recognize which of the images are truly important and which aren't for the field of math. The juiciness of the narrative—on computer imaging made early steps against logical proofs—loses some momentum to their trying too hard to say that the images mean something. <a href="http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/nonlinear-dynamics-and-chaos-with-applications-to-physics-biology-chemistry-and-engineering">Strogatz' book</a> would have done them well.</p>

        <p><em><a href="http://thediagram.com/16_5/mapof.html">MAP OF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ILLINOIS CORNFIELD</a> on DIAGRAM 16.5</em></p>

<p>DIAGRAM is wonderful, and this image seems timely. Finding ways to portray and generate empathy around America's heartland seems more necessary than ever.</p>

<p>It's a dark time to be an American. As much as it was foreseeable, I really didn't want to believe Trump would win. <a href="http://qz.com/833859/with-trump-as-president-china-will-be-the-worlds-biggest-champion-of-fighting-climate-change/">Quartz Summarizes the environmental implications briefly</a>, noting that with Trump as the figurehead, America has lost its energy leadership position internationally, and has become addled domestically. It wasn't looking bright anyway, and now it's downright apocalyptic. <a href="https://www.greatagain.gov/policy/energy-independence.html">Trump's Energy Policy</a> reads like an 8th-grade short-response essay, and not even a good one at that.</p>

<p>Environmental, climate, and land-use issues seem like my battlefield of choice because it's here that my voice is needed. As a straight white atheistic man with an American passport, it's not my face that needs to represent America in the 21st century. While I need to do my part on-the-ground, I can leverage my technical background and demographic most in science and policy. I want to do all I can to counteract my violent filling of space.</p>

<p>There aren't excuses for anything less. Is my life and work oriented towards civic benefit? Am I critical not only of myself, but also at least a few layers of abstraction above and below me? Am I amplifying voices who need it, rather than my own? Don't forget, too, that <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~field/holzer/truisms.txt">ANY SURPLUS IS IMMORAL (thanks, Jenny)</a>. And, in one of the most striking reads of recent history, there's only so much <a href="http://thebaffler.com/blog/laurie-penny-self-care">self-care you can justify</a>, too.</p>

<p>"Youth is wasted on the young," they say, and I've been trying to make that not true for myself. Youth, though, does bring a weight—our interests and habits at a young age reverberate long through life. As someone without burning desires, I've struggled to commit myself to things out of fear that I'll trap myself for too long. I've been pretty paralyzed for years. Time to commit.</p>

<p>How are you feeling? If you are in LA or on the internet and need a hug, a burrito, or a conversation, let me know. We're together in this revolt.</p>

<p>If you want a playlist for diving into what I'll call a "heavy headspace" (deep ambient?), I recommend: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59BIX16RSkU">Selfless State by So Inagawa</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqmA5GDBdWM">Broken by Roberto Rodriguez</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1V5AyscLAI">LOVE by James Booth</a>, and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LtsjqgF6fw">Nuit Sonores by Floating Points</a>.

        <p><em>Car Plunge</em> - Ken Price, 1994</p>

<p>There's a short concrete tunnel—an underpass, I guess—if you're on the 105 West and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/33%C2%B055'52.5%22N+118%C2%B021'55.7%22W/@33.931243,-118.3676517,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d33.931243!4d-118.365463">take the exit for the 405 South to Long Beach</a>. It takes maybe 15 seconds to drive through at 65mph, and is sheltered enough to make the radio turn to static.</p>

<p>These days, in the car, I'm often listening to the radio. I quit spotify when I wanted to trim costs on my life, and now I just watch youtube if I ever want to listen to something. <a href="http://www.jazzandblues.org/index.aspx/">The radio</a> remains a lovely way to tune into the local culture and find some surprise.</p>

<p>I've been taking this exit a lot as I drive between Los Angeles and Manhattan Beach, where I'm staying by the generosity of a friend's family. (I'm slowly, slowly saving up for a security deposit to move into LA proper.) The few seconds of static are always a warm welcome, despite the blaring tunnel lights that accompany them: it's a reminder that I'm listening to the radio, that this music is flying through the air to me with careful frequency modulations, and when the audio fades back in, it's all the more appreciated.</p>

<p>I gave the graduation speech at my high school and started the speech, more or less, with this quote:</p>

<p><code>For a long time it seemed to me that life was about to begin, but there was always some obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some unfinished business, time to still be served, a debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that these obstacles were my life.</code></p>

<p>Five years later and still pertinent. I've been putting off a lot until I get an apartment—but the catch 22 is that I can't afford an apartment until I get my shit together anyway. Instead, I'm nurturing the ability to do a little laptop work from anywhere and am happy with the driver's seat of my Dad's Subaru as the most consistent home I have. Just like with the tunnel, sometimes a transition should be celebrated as a thing itself.</p>

<p>My life is pretty low-margin right now. I have some lists around of art I'd love to buy and restaurants I'd like to try, but none of that can be justified when my money needs to go towards groceries, gas, and some new socks. I think I'll be really happy when I can buy a surfboard, but really I'm thankful for how much simpler things feel when I rule out all unnecessary purchases.</p>

<p><img src="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/654263/large_a2e587be5e313884d5981af65d0c5821.jpg" alt="There Is No Such Thing As Ethical Consumption Under Capitalism">
<em>From <a href="https://www.are.na/lukas-wp/communist-memes">this memes channel</a>.</em></p>

<p>Margins on everything seem pretty slim, when you factor in externalities. My gasoline is subsidized by the smog I'm tossing into the valleys, burritos by underpaid line-cooks, my laptop by suicidal working conditions in Chinese factories. Gosh, I have a hard time justifying doing or using almost anything under late-stage capitalism.</p>

<p>The goal is to do good on this. Do work I can morally justify, that helps negotiate some of the deluge of negative externalities. To be in transition and enjoy it, holding out for nothing.</p>
