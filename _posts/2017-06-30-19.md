I am now full-time employed as a "Math Fellow" (read: incoming math instructor) at the [Renaissance Arts Academy](https://www.renarts.org/), an performing arts-focused alternative charter school in Northeast Los Angeles. 

The fit is pretty ideal. As I wrote in my last post, I'm finding direction by asking myself what things I'm _invested_ in, rather than just what things I'm _interested_ in (which is everything). I'm invested in the effective teaching of mathematics, and during college I did two independent studies on "alternative" math pedagogy—the first around "multimodal" (or "[Sensory Math](https://www.are.na/lukas-wp/sensory-math--2)") methods, the second on structuring the math class like an art studio. Now I have a place to apply much of my research and learn from on-the-ground math instructors, daily. 

Additionally, they need help in their woodshop and establishing some metalworking facility, so my inclinations in that direction are also engaged. 

The school is delicately arranged and picky about vocabulary. No "students," just "scholars." No "teachers," just "advisors." Nearly all of the scholars are in one enormous room during a regular school day and classes ("rotations") are defined by whoever is sitting in a clump. The grades 6-12 are fully mixed—one class rotation might include a scholar of every year. Scholars are expected to know where they should be. There's a lot of agency put on the kids to figure out how to apply themselves and get things done. The results are generally positive with only a couple drifters. 

Scholars help determine the direction of some programs, and they play huge roles in developing the music and staging and choreography of the end-of-semester shows, which are the showcases of the school. 

RenArts is dealing with primary & secondary education and is restricted by some age ability, but I cannot help but be reminded of [Black Mountain College](https://www.are.na/lukas-wp/black-mountain-college--2), a 1933-1957 experimental art-focused college near Asheville, North Carolina. 

Black Mountain College was student-focused by model and necessity. While ideologically and pedagogically fueled by ex-faculty from elsewhere in the world and the time period's famous avante-garde artists, it was the students that made it, literally: design and construction of the school's buildings was largely up to student committees and teams. Much administration was done by students. The organization of the school, the direction of (much of) its curriculum, and its culture, were defined by students. The faculty was there as guidance and fuel. 

[Deep Springs](http://www.deepsprings.edu/) has taken this model even further, on a tiny, remote scale.

RenArts, BMC, and Deep Springs alike root their liberal-arts educations in the pragmatic agency of fabrication and administration. It brings the world in, and channels a _[Zen in the Art of Archery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_in_the_Art_of_Archery)_-flavor energy of spirituality in labor. 

What I've read about BMC in books and shows at the [Hamburger Bahnhof](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/arts/artsspecial/in-the-spirit-of-black-mountain-college-an-avant-garde-incubator.html) and [ICA Boston](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/arts/design/the-short-life-and-long-legacy-of-black-mountain-college.html) supports that it saw validation of individual experiences and observation as crucial to building student agency in the space. But an individual's experiences had to then be presented to the community, in support of community goals. The work happens together, stimulated by synthesis of individual experiences. 

This manifests literally in the "flipped" classroom model, too, where the "work" happens together as a group, while individual students do reading and reflection alone. In many education environments, what happens is the _opposite_! Classrooms become rooms to read (often because it's the simplest possible activity), and the work happens at home. 

I'm still getting my bearings, but life is good. Much of my experience at RenArts can support [Learning Gardens](http://learning-gardens.co/) and on the weekends you can find me [at the beach](https://www.instagram.com/p/BVnFeeBFgjP/?taken-by=moon_as_a_skull).
