name: Paragraphs From the House of Slugs
-
words1:

I spent 5 weeks in Summer 2015 living in a big, old, empty house in the Netherlands. I wrote a few paragraphs every day on my experiences, my thoughts, my family, and the house. 

I worked and reworked the paragraphs to summarize my surreal and lonely summer. The result was published in [Clerestory Arts](http://www.clerestoryarts.com/) v.53 n.02.
