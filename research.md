# Research

I am a researcher and educator, with a Ph.D from the University of California. There, I worked closely with Dr Mark Stacey (UC Berkeley) and Dr Jessie Lacy (USGS) on hydrodynamics and sediment transport in shallow bays and marshlands. Now, I am a postdoctoral scholar at the California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo, assessing coastal hazards along California's Central Coast and teaching classes related to coastal hydraulics. 

My interests focus on how coastal and estuarine hydrodynamics transport sediment or other material. Thus, I study: 

- estuarine hydrodynamics and coastal oceanography
- sedimentation, geomorphology, and landscape change in estuaries
- restoration engineering and "blue carbon" assessment
- effective use and design of environmental sensors
- applications relevant to ecologic health and infrastructure

While I work primarily as a field scientist, I believe there is value in connecting in-situ observations to larger spatiotemporal scales using remote sensing techniques and numerical models.

Outside of technical questions, I am energized by cultural theory and historical ecology around bodies of water and infrastructure. I support degrowth-oriented and citizen-centered environmental science, management, and activism. This requires good pedagogy, low-impact/cost methods, small-group organizing, long-term monitoring, and capable institutions. I love doing outreach to younger folks and channel my energy mostly through <a href="https://www.citysurfproject.com/">City Surf Project</a> in San Francisco.
