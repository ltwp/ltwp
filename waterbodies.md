We call our home the blue planet but it can be hard to believe when California goes brown. You can always find the blue inside you. (I mean it.) When I am blue I head to the ocean.

When was the last time you went for a swim? When was the last time you thought of yourself as porous? What's the nearest body of water? Is it you?

__waterbodies__ is a workshop to connect with the water around you. waterbodies wants you to get wet! waterbodies wants you to remember what water tastes like! waterbodies wants you to know where the water comes from, and where it goes! waterbodies wants you to feel that complexity is natural! waterbodies wants you to feel like you belong here! waterbodies wants you to melt into the world and find yourself anyway.

__Saturday, May 25th at 1pm at magic & pasta in Berkeley, CA, Ohlone land__. (Navigate to 1135 Page St, then turn right on Kains Ave to find the second garage on the right) Please wear shoes that can get wet. Bring a towel, water bottle, and memories of childhood if you can.

The workshop will consist of drawing and writing exercises, various methods of getting wet, guided discussion and reflection, and a walk following Cordonices creek up to its headwaters. The workshop is organized by me and Helen, Kendal, and John of [magic & pasta](https://magicandpasta.space/).
