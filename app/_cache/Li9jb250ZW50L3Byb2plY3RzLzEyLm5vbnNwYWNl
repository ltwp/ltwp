        Providence, RI, 2014
      </div>

      <p>In Fall 2014, <a href="http://main.bradtroemel.com/">Brad Troemel</a> came and spoke in Providence through the Creative Mind Initiative. He told stories of being an undergrad at SAIC, where students would push all the furniture out of their apartments and hold small shows of their friends' artwork. I was enamored with this idea, and had a number of friends who were artists or designers.</p>

<p>In November, I found myself in possession of a pair of keys that unlocked an empty apartment. With the help of my friends Elizabeth Goodspeed, Polina Godz, Jordan Beard, and Nathan Zack, we threw a one-night, pop-up, 12-artist show.</p>
