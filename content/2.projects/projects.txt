## About Me

I'm an applied mathematician with broad interests. I like structures, spaces, dynamics.

View [my writing](http://ltwp.net/projects/writing) and [my workshops](http://ltwp.net/projects/workshops).

I am currently:

- Finishing my BS at Brown University
- TAing in the Division of Applied Mathematics
- Managing the [Brown Design Workshop](http://www.brown.edu/research/projects/design-workshop/about-us)
- Giving tours at the [RISD Museum](http://risdmuseum.org)

Previously, professionally, I have done fluids research on an NSF grant, technical research on social systems and networks at [Thicket](http://thisisthicket.net), and furniture building with [Boris Bally](http://borisbally.com). I continue to be associated with [Brown STEAM](http://brown.steamwith.us).

Hire me if you want to:

+ make/analyze dynamic or agent-based math models
+ do interdisciplinary research
+ plan and execute technical workshops
+ talk about art
+ organize your digital and physical things
+ play with javascript libraries
+ construct garments or make furniture
