# Research

I am a researcher and teacher, currently as a PhD candidate working with Mark Stacey out of University of California Berkeley's <a href="https://ucb-efmh.github.io/efmh-site/students">EFMH Group</a>. I enjoy collaborating with many people! During graduate school I have worked extensively with Jessie Lacy and other scientists out of the US Geological Survey's <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc">Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center</a>. I have also been a part of the <a href="https://largier.sf.ucdavis.edu">Coastal Oceanography Group</a> at UCD in Davis, California, and the <a href="http://obrasciviles.usm.cl/investigacion/lineas-de-investigacion/estudios-de-procesos-e-ingenieria-costera/">Grupo de Procesos e Ingeniería Costera</a> at USM in Valparaíso, Chile.

At the broadest scale, I am interested in the myriad forces that affect how coastal waters and intertidal systems "work". I seek to study:

- coastal hydrodynamics, oceanography, and sediment transport
- geomorphology and landscape change around estuaries
- restoration engineering and blue carbon assessment
- effective use and design of environmental sensors
- applying all of the above where relevant to ecology and infrastructure

I work primarily as a field scientist, but I understand that connecting field data to larger spatiotemporal scales using remote sensing and modeling applications is crucial. 

Outside of technical questions, I am energized by cultural theory and historical ecology of water and infrastructure. I want to support degrowth-oriented and citizen-centered environmental science, management, and activism. This requires good pedagogy, low-impact/cost methods, small-group organizing, and capable institutions.

<!-- 
I’m a field scientist focused on hydrodynamics, transport, and geomorphology in bays, estuaries, and the coastal ocean. I enjoy where these topics overlap with environmental monitoring via in-situ or remote sensing, oceanography, infrastructure, and management. I enjoy teaching and have spent years studying and working in alternative educational environments.
