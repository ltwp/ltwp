# Seasonal and Spatial Patterns of Sediment Transport in an Erosional Salt Marsh

Welcome to a little webpage that supports my poster at PECS 2024! My name is Lukas and if you have any questions, you can email me at lukas_wp@berkeley.edu. 

The GIF below helps illustrate the rapid (~1.5 m/yr) erosion underway at Whale's Tail Marsh ([google maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p3ajbcpE9FRZGSYU6)).

The strong seasonality of the edge retreat (rapid in the windy spring/summer, slow in the stormy fall/winter) is detailed in the paper _[Seasonality of Retreat Rate of a Wave-Exposed Marsh Edge](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023JF007468?casa_token=zmTN4a_0tGkAAAAA%3Aj6vtXbLrT0Y_jxLrM33-IYDBCms2_b1T6VybP2UKS74I_IIPJOm2SukxJGJgBuNTs9H55TRHB_lkozIX)_. This work was built off of publicly-available climatologic data as well as aerial imagery of the marsh ([data released here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/6308060ad34e3b967a8c15c7)), and a modeled wave field in San Francisco Bay using Delft3D-Wave ([model results here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/64b9688ed34e70357a2bf187)). The wind seasonality is evident in the following figure:

This change is in the context of at least decadal retreat of the marsh-edge, which we know from other aerial imagery. The marsh itself has been modified over the past century (compilation by Dan Nowacki):

For the sediment budget in this paper, we broke Whale's Tail Marsh into a number of zones, based on which source of water (tidal creek or bay) was closest, and presumed to "fill" that zone.

On to these zones we imposed relationships from sediment tiles vs. distance from water ([data published here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/64ff51e4d34ed30c2057b3ae)) in order to create a model of how much deposition was occuring across the entire marsh. The answer is that most occurs very close to the creek-edge, as well as in a band near the bay-edge although this is inset some meters (2-10) due to wave activity. The large extent of the creek network means that the creeks dominate the sediment import, even though the bay-edge imports more sediment on a per-meter-width basis.

The sediment imported to the Cargill Marsh, east of Whale's Tail, was estimated by Dan Nowacki (USGS) in his upcoming paper, _Linking tidal-creek sediment fluxes to vertical sediment accumulation in a restored salt marsh_. Hydrodynamic data for this study were collected in-situ ([data available here](https://cmgds.marine.usgs.gov/data-releases/datarelease/10.5066-P972R6AW/)). 

Both Dan Nowacki's paper and mine ([draft PDF here](http://amphidromic.net/images/pecs/wtm_sediment_draft.pdf)) are submitted to ESPL and undergoing review. Stay tuned for an additional paper on these data by McKenna Bristow on blue carbon capture and loss!
